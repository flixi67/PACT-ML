# PACT-ML
Code for the ML (Group) Project @Hertie.

## Disclaimer

The roBERTa model was around ~1GB, and even with LFS, I could not find a way to upload it. I have it saved as .zip, in case you need to take a look.

I used claude.ai and OpenAI effectively for coding, writing helpers, plotting, writing frameworks, research, and bug fixing. I checked all results. However, all errors are my own.
