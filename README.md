# PACT-ML
Code for the ML (Group) Project @Hertie.

## Installation

You can directly clone a virtual environment from the 'environment.yml' file. Please note that 'dolcing' is currently not available in the conda environment manager and needs to be installed manually to be used in editable dev mode, i.e. training a custom document parsing pipeline.

'''
git clone https://github.com/docling-project/docling.git
cd docling
pip install -e .
