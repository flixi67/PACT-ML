The commission has not yet been established, however, and MINUSTAH continued to encourage the Transitional Government to do so as a matter of priority.",14,data/pdfs\MINUSTAH_S_2004_698.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2004_698.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2004_698,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
"16. The Transitional Government’s setting of a deadline for armed groups, other than HNP, to stop claiming to exercise security functions (see para. 11 above) underlines the urgency for it to put in place a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration framework.

Members of the party repeatedly alleged that they were subjected to political persecution and staged public demonstrations to demand the release of individuals they claim are political prisoners. The Transitional Government’s decision to place a number of Fanmi Lavalas supporters on a list barring them from leaving the country was criticized by Fanmi Lavalas and by a number of human rights organizations. The arrest of former Prime Minister Yvon Neptune on 27 June has been pointed to by many members of Fanmi Lavalas as evidence of political persecution against them. While Mr. Neptune had been detained for his alleged involvement in a massacre in Saint-Marc in February 2004, to date no official charges have been brought against him. He remains in detention.

There are also signs that some moderate members may be considering joining the political transition process, if the Transitional Government were to take measures to prevent political persecution. To capitalize on this momentum and as a continuation of efforts undertaken by my Special Adviser early in June to facilitate a rapprochement between the Transitional Government and Fanmi Lavalas, MINUSTAH provided good offices in an effort to broker an agreement between them on the entry of Fanmi Lavalas into the political transition process. A group of former members of Fanmi Lavalas, led by former Senators Prince Pierre Sonson and Dany Toussaint, formed a new political party on 31 July 2004 — the Mouvement démocratique et réformateur haïtien (MODEREH). Although it has not formally signed the Consensus on the Political Transition Pact, it has indicated that it intends to compete in the next elections and be fully involved in the national dialogue by advocating tolerance and reconciliation.

However, funding currently pledged for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities, including from ICF, remains very limited, and additional financial support from the Transitional Government and the international community is urgently needed.

As of February 2005, due to its increased strength, the MINUSTAH civilian police component has also been in a position to place greater emphasis on the training and capacity-building of HNP, through a co-location programme, which consists of mentoring, advising and assisting HNP at all levels. The training of 200 officers (185 men and 15 women) belonging to the fifteenth HNP class was completed; they graduated on 21 January 2005, together with 193 former military who are to be integrated into HNP.

The Government of Canada contributed 17 million Canadian dollars and the Government of the United States of America $9.4 million to the OAS voter registration programme. The European Union and the Transitional Government pledged €10 million and $2.9 million, respectively. UNDP contributed $400,000. This will allow CEP to prepare for the elections with activities such as infrastructure rehabilitation for voter registration offices and the purchase of vehicles and office equipment. Funding, however, remains a concern. Not only is there a shortfall of $5.6 million in the amount pledged to the global funding agreement, but the budget on which the agreement was based will be insufficient to allow CEP to carry out fully its necessary activities.

"40. MINUSTAH and UNICEF, as well as national and international human rights organizations, drew attention to continued violence against children. According to witness testimony obtained by MINUSTAH, on 1 December 2004, while chasing suspected gang members, HNP officers shot at students inside a school near the Bel- Air district of Port-au-Prince, wounding several of them. Officials working at the morgue in the General Hospital in Port-au-Prince reported to MINUSTAH several cases of street children being shot dead by unidentified assailants. According to human rights groups and interviews conducted by MINUSTAH, among the perpetrators of the violence against children in the capital were individuals dressed in black, such as those who allegedly perpetrated the killings in the Fort National district in October 2004 (see S/2004/908, para. 13). This information has been corroborated through investigations conducted by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Haitian Office of the Ombudsman. MINUSTAH’s civilian police and human rights officers are currently carrying out investigations of several conducted in cooperation with the General Inspectorate of HNP (see paras. 17 and 35). It is expected that the capacity of MINUSTAH in this area will soon be expanded to enable it to conduct a larger number of such investigations. Gang members have also been involved in violence against children. Human rights organizations, local associations and medical staff at the main hospital inside Cité Soleil told MINUSTAH that, during the months prior to the MINUSTAH/HNP December 2004 operation in Cité Soleil, an estimated 30 to 40 children had reportedly died violent deaths in the shantytown in the context of gang violence.

The situation in Gonaïves has improved as a result of the coordinated efforts of the Transitional Government, humanitarian organizations, United Nations agencies and MINUSTAH. Most basic services have been restored, but structural problems, already present before the disaster took place, will need to be addressed through more complex and long-term programming. Since the beginning of the humanitarian response in Gonaïves, nearly 4,000 metric tons of food commodities from the World Food Programme have been distributed in the affected areas. Since November 2004, as Gonaïves and other affected areas recovered from the disaster, general food distribution was gradually replaced by targeted programmes. Approximately 2,000 people who lost their homes continue to live in some 20 temporary shelters in Gonaïves, Port-de-Paix and other affected areas.

In addition, as of mid-January 2005, MINUSTAH had funded 47 quick- impact projects throughout the 10 administrative departments of Haiti. Particular emphasis has been placed on extremely poor areas hit by violence — including the shantytown of Cité Soleil in Port-au-Prince — where rehabilitation, sanitation and health programmes are being implemented. These programmes will expand when the security situation has further improved. The MINUSTAH civilian and military coordination team conducted a series of humanitarian and socio-economic activities in the administrative departments of the north and north-east, in close collaboration with local authorities. In addition to helping in the implementation of quick-impact projects in these regions, MINUSTAH troops based in Cap Haïtien have offered technical training in electricity, mechanics, food processing and other areas to local youths.

Different perceptions were expressed on how to overcome this situation. Regardless of the approach, the mission found that there was broad agreement that a solution to the country’s current situation would not be reached in the short term. While elections were seen as a first and essential step in the process, they were not seen as the comprehensive solution to the crisis. The process of stabilization and normalization in a number of areas, being addressed in parallel, would need to continue for some time. Social and economic recovery would need to be strengthened. The mission found that there appeared to be general commitment and support for those goals among national actors, but such commitment had generally not been translated into concrete actions and deliverable results. In addition, the buy-in of the population, particularly outside the capital and among the young people, was unclear.

"16. It was only after MINUSTAH neared its authorized level of military and police personnel that it was able to deploy throughout the country and increasingly take a more robust approach. The overall security situation, particularly in the capital, had improved as a result of recent successes in security operations against gangs in Cité Soleil and Bel-Air; and against elements of the former military who had taken over former President Aristide’s residence in the Tabarre district of Port-au-Prince, and against those who had taken over police stations in Petit-Goâve and Terre Rouge. The most recent operation undertaken by MINUSTAH in support of the Haitian National Police had resulted in the deaths on 9 and 10 April, respectively, of the leader of one of the gangs and a leader of the former military, who have both been responsible for fomenting instability in the country. The mission learned that the joint operations had successfully undermined the recent worrying alliances between illegal armed groups, that is, gangs associated with Mr. Aristide’s supporters and elements of the former military.

To promote the trust and confidence of the population in the police, many interlocutors underlined the need to ensure transparent recruitment and to vet those already in the police service, including elements of the former military.

It also found that the capacity and capabilities of the Commission would need to be enhanced.

"28. The mission was pleased to note that MINUSTAH was supporting the Transitional Government in its efforts to launch an approach to disarmament building on socio-economic development. However, the mission was of the opinion that it was imperative to focus not only on the long-term aspects but also on the immediate need for disarmament in view of the political timetable. There was therefore, a need for a credible deterrent vis-à-vis those elements that did not wish to engage in the process, coupled with an even-handed and comprehensive application of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process to those willing to participate. Otherwise, the security situation could be further undermined by frustrated and discontented individuals who might abandon the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process and even rejoin illegal armed groups. The mission condemned all violence and called on the Haitian authorities to implement as a matter of priority a comprehensive programme of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration to disarm all of the illegal armed groups, with the assistance of MINUSTAH. signs that the attitude towards disarmament, demobilization and reintegration was evolving. The mission learned that, although there was an increased willingness to participate in a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme on the part of members of the former military, some were not satisfied with the benefits offered since they were primarily interested in being reabsorbed into public sector positions (especially in the national police). It was deemed necessary to provide a concrete response to the social demands of the former military, with a view to reintegrating them into the formal economy, as an essential element in the promotion of peace and stability in the country. The mission was however concerned to learn that promises had been made by the Transitional Government to members of the former military, in respect of indemnity payments, pensions and State employment, which were not linked to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, particularly the need to disarm. Furthermore, some of the promises had not been kept. Unfulfilled promises have the potential to destabilize the situation and exacerbate frustrations and alienation.

"31. The mission was struck by the complex nature of the political landscape, with some 90 registered political parties and a myriad of civil society organizations, which did not appear to have clearly identifiable political platforms for the future of the country. The mission stressed to the political leaders the need to present their long-term objectives for the country, as well as political platforms that conveyed the parties’ views on how they would address pressing issues such as widespread unemployment. The mission, in the course of its visit, was informed about possible linkages between some political parties and illegal armed groups, which remain a deep source of concern, especially in view of the forthcoming electoral period. The mission was reminded of the difficulty for MINUSTAH to play a role in promoting the political transition, given the fragility of the Transitional Government, the numerous political players, and the Haitian people’s strong desire to chart their own political path. Haitian interlocutors made it very clear to the mission that they themselves must take the lead in this process, a position that was supported by the mission.",31,data/pdfs\MINUSTAH_S_2005_302.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2005_302.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2008_202,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
"36. Given the still precarious situation in Port-au-Prince and the lack of progress in disarmament at the national level, security for the electoral period was a prominent theme throughout the mission’s discussions with its interlocutors. Members of the Provisional Electoral Council reminded the mission of their own vulnerability, noting that the Council’s headquarters had been attacked twice during the week the registration was originally scheduled to begin. Moreover, members of the Electoral Council expressed deep concern that any attacks against civilians early in the registration period could severely undermine any efforts to encourage potential voters to participate in the electoral process. Reflecting such a concern, a religious leader stressed that electoral participation in Haiti should not require people to put their lives at risk to exercise their right to vote.",36,data/pdfs\MINUSTAH_S_2005_302.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2005_302.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2008_202,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
"37. The Interim Prime Minister proposed that the security arrangements be reinforced during the electoral period, including through the deployment of additional French-speaking MINUSTAH civilian police officers. The mission noted that there was a plan to recruit and train electoral security assistants to provide security to the registration centres and subsequently to the polling stations, but many interlocutors felt that this would be insufficient and that MINUSTAH military and police forces would still need to provide security at the polling stations. The mission welcomed the participation of MINUSTAH in the electoral security commission created by the Interim Prime Minister, which brings together representatives from the Provisional Electoral Council, the national police and the Transitional Government.",37,data/pdfs\MINUSTAH_S_2005_302.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2005_302.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2008_202,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
"41. Given the country’s historical background, many Haitians remain sceptical about the prospects for the forthcoming elections. Several actors repeatedly stressed that elections were only one of numerous steps to be taken in building a democratic society. Some were concerned that the elections might simply pave the way for a new “dictatorial era” if nothing was done to reform the judicial sector and the State apparatus. Others raised the difficulty of ensuring inclusivity, given the polarized political landscape. The mission is firmly of the view that the Haitian people need to be informed that the elections will lead to significant change. It is clear that, for the elections to be successful, people will need to be psychologically prepared to participate. Numerous interlocutors stressed the need for civic education at all levels and to reach out to all sectors of the population, particularly the youth. Political leaders, for their part, must prepare the ground for free and fair elections, commit themselves to peacefully accepting the results, and assume the responsibility of meeting voters’ expectations in the post-electoral period. The mission called upon all leaders of the country to take full responsibility for the sovereign affairs of Haiti and fulfil their responsibility for improving the lives of their constituents once they are elected to office.

It had also proved difficult to engage the of the population and the ambiguous attitude of the Transitional Government, as indicated above. In this regard, it was suggested that a national procedure could be established for the filing of complaints against members of the national police or the international civilian police. Other challenges were noted, such as the national capacity to effectively uphold human rights and the over-reliance on MINUSTAH civilian police and the national police in the conduct of such investigations.",43,data/pdfs\MINUSTAH_S_2005_302.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2005_302.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2008_202,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
"45. Virtually all Haitian interlocutors identified themselves with the statement of a Transitional Government official that poverty is “the underlying root of unrest in Haiti”, as well as the consensus view that there could be no genuine stability in the country without the strengthening of its economy. Both the Haitian interlocutors and the mission stressed the need for a long-term strategy to promote development and combat poverty. In cooperation with the donor community, the Transitional Government has developed an interim poverty reduction strategy, the Interim Cooperation Framework. All interlocutors underlined the need to accelerate and streamline donor funding in order to visibly improve living conditions for the Haitian population, and to ensure that the Transitional Government had the capacity to develop and implement projects. They welcomed the implementation of the projects identified by the recent international conference held in Cayenne, which were selected according to their ability to rapidly disburse funds and to respond to the most urgent needs of the population in such fields as road-building, electricity generation, governance and access to basic services.",45,data/pdfs\MINUSTAH_S_2005_302.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2005_302.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2008_202,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

At his meeting with the mission, the Interim Prime Minister underlined the need for Haitian priorities to be taken into account, donor funds to be spent within Haiti, and tangible improvement in the country’s basic infrastructure, particularly electricity, the exploration of renewable sources of energy such as solar, wind and water power, and the development of the country’s 3,000 kilometres of roads, which would facilitate the growth of the agricultural sector in the north and allow farmers to bring goods to market. For his part, the Interim President cited as priorities the development of the agricultural sector through irrigation resources, the building of roads and electricity generation, and the need to combat deforestation and environmental degradation. from the Interim Cooperation Framework, the mission was reminded of the enormous development challenges in Haiti which, in fact, represent a situation worse in many aspects than in countries that have undergone years of conflict. The mission was informed that, owing to the country’s dire economic, social and political plight, there was little hope that Haiti — where public health indicators are the worst in the region, life expectancy is 50 years and infant mortality is 80 per 1,000 — would achieve any of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals until 2015, unless a focused and urgent international cooperation initiative were launched for that purpose. At the same time, the mission is convinced that short- term economic progress is not only possible but also essential in the lead-up to the elections, provided that rapid disbursement of donor funds is ensured and projects are agreed upon with Haitian priorities in mind.",46,data/pdfs\MINUSTAH_S_2005_302.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2005_302.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2008_202,True,False,False,False,False,False,True

The mission was also briefed on additional ways in which MINUSTAH implements the integrated mission concept with a view to promoting long-term development in collaboration with United Nations agencies. Five main areas of cooperation were cited, namely, disarmament, justice, elections, national dialogue and child protection. Other areas highlighted were the work of UNICEF and MINUSTAH to combat child trafficking in Haiti, a country where about half of the population is under 15, as well as the efforts of a network of United Nations agencies working on women’s issues. On the latter, the mission acknowledged that the current climate of violence, insecurity and impunity marginalized Haitian women in their daily lives and, in particular, left them vulnerable to sexual violence.

"50. The mission found that the State institutions in Haiti at all levels remained weak and in urgent need of reform and capacity-building. Some interlocutors said that State institutions faced continuing problems of corruption, lack of capacity of the civil service, absence of transparency and accountability and lack of necessary equipment. The population was also seen as alienated from the administration, leading to poor governance, which contributed to the country’s current situation. At the same time, the mission found that progress had been achieved in key sectors such as addressing the deficit in the budget through improvements in fiscal procedures and governance. In essence, the mission considered that a modern public administration did not yet exist in the country. outlying regions. Gonaïves, for example, has not had a serving mayor since December 2004.

To increase the Mission’s ability to deal with potential civil disorder in connection with the electoral campaign and the aftermath of the elections, MINUSTAH needs to reorient existing resources and to enhance its coverage of the country with formed police units. It is envisaged that one of the units currently in Port-au-Prince would move to Cap-Haïtien prior to the elections. As previously reported (S/2004/908, para. 53), an additional formed police unit of 125 officers within the current authorized strength would be deployed. Of these, 40 personnel have already been added to one of the Jordanian units in Port-au-Prince, and 85 officers from Senegal, constituting the seventh unit, will be deployed to Hinche shortly. Since Hinche is likely to continue to be a particularly sensitive area, this seventh unit should be deployed there on a permanent basis. In addition to the already authorized force, one additional formed police units should be deployed in Port-au-Prince as surge capacity until after the new government is installed in February 2006.

MINUSTAH experience in assisting the national police has shown the pressing need to strengthen the role of civilian police officers in providing practical guidance to the Haitian police at all levels. In order to address these needs, MINUSTAH will require that the numbers making up the seventh formed police unit and the strengthened Jordanian unit be replenished by new civilian police personnel (125 officers) whose deployment had been postponed to allow for the establishment of the formed police units as well as 25 additional officers.

"25. According to the benchmarks established in the reform plan, it is envisaged that the Haitian National Police would increase from its current strength by a rate of approximately 1,500 officers a year, to 14,000 by 2011. The plan notes that the latter figure should be sufficient to undertake essential policing functions. At the same time, it indicates that further security capacity, up to a total staffing of 20,000, would be required to undertake the full range of security tasks, and that an appropriate plan would need to be devised for its development. To date, some 8,070 Haitian National Police officers and 1,580 civilian employees have been registered within a United Nations police database which will also serve the Haitian National Police. A further 600 candidates for the Haitian National Police, including 30 women, will begin training courses in January 2007. With regard to gender representation, some 6.5 per cent of Haitian National Police officers and 12 per cent of Haitian National Police employees are women. In an effort to combat discrimination against women within the institution and ensure that gender is mainstreamed in all their activities, the Haitian National Police have recently established gender focal points throughout the country. They are currently undergoing training in collaboration with MINUSTAH.

"26. In July, the Mission conducted a detailed threat assessment, which identified three security threats facing Haiti. First, there is the likelihood of civil unrest, which is increased by an environment marked by the persistence of a deep socio-economic divide and compounded by high unemployment and high expectations on the part of the people. Secondly, the potential for renewed armed violence within the country remains considerable. Despite the fact that many suspected criminals have been apprehended in 2007, relatively few weapons have been confiscated, and many former gang members, who could be persuaded to resume their gang activities by spoilers with political or criminal motives, remain at large. Thirdly, the illicit traffic in drugs, arms and contraband remains a critical factor. If not addressed, illicit trafficking will continue to corrupt State institutions.

Since my last report, MINUSTAH has been focusing its efforts on addressing two threats to the displaced population, namely, physical insecurity and forced evictions. Living conditions in the camps, including overcrowding, poorly secured tents, open washing areas and inadequate lighting, have contributed to security incidents, including sexual and gender-based violence. Cases of forced — and at times violent — evictions have become increasingly common in recent months, as landowners wished to recover their property.

During the reporting period, MINUSTAH continued to support the decentralization efforts of the Ministry of the Interior, including by designing a performance assessment system to facilitate the monitoring of municipalities’ administrative and financial management, service delivery and local development activities. The matrix allows MINUSTAH to make semi-annual assessments of progress and constraints, as well as training needs. The Ministry of the Interior has expressed interest in appropriating the tool for future use. From April to July, MINUSTAH monitored the execution of the 2010/11 municipal budgets and assisted the Ministry in updating the guidelines for the preparation of municipal budgets. Those guidelines have been put into effect as part of the 2011/12 municipal budget drafting process, which MINUSTAH and the Ministry jointly supervised between July and August 2011. In an effort to increase ministerial institutional memory, MINUSTAH assisted the Ministry in drawing up an inventory of ongoing projects and files.

The post-earthquake surge was predicated on the need to provide MINUSTAH with additional resources to support the humanitarian relief effort, while continuing to maintain a secure and stable environment and contribute to the restoration of Haitian institutional capacity. The assessment conducted at the request of the Security Council in its resolution 1944 (2010) found that the earthquake had not resulted in a breakdown of law and order, nor had it altered the nature of the security threats facing Haiti. With the winding down of large-scale humanitarian operations and the completion of the elections, many of the additional challenges that had justified the increase in the Mission’s authorized troop and police strength have been met or have decreased significantly. In this regard, the protection of internally displaced persons and the provision of engineering support for recovery and reconstruction constitute the two primary new tasks taken on by the Mission since the earthquake. The former task will continue to absorb a significant portion of the Mission’s capabilities, albeit on a decreasing scale, until durable solutions such as housing and resettlement solutions are found.

The work of MINUSTAH in anticipation of these elections, which will renew a third of the Senate and elect municipal officials (mayors, town delegates, communal section councils and assemblies), has so far focused on boundary delimitation and potential amendments to the Electoral Law. Owing to delays in the nomination and establishment of a new electoral council and the announcement of the electoral calendar, it will not be possible to hold elections by 8 May 2012, when a third of the existing Senators reach the end of their term in office.

Recently, the legal aid funding partner, the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), informed stakeholders, including MINUSTAH, of its decision to end the financing of Haiti’s legal aid programme. The Government of Haiti has indicated to MINUSTAH that it intends to take over the management of the legal aid programme. In January 2012, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security established a transitional working group, with the participation of MINUSTAH and other stakeholders, to prepare a development plan for a sustainable legal aid system and review the draft law establishing the Système national d’assistance légale. In conjunction with UNDP, MINUSTAH conducted 2 two-day workshops in Croix des Bouquets and Jérémie to train a group of 30 police officers, judges and prosecutors, including four women, on investigative techniques in sexual assault cases.

"38. MINUSTAH assistance in corrections took the form of capacity-building in security, staffing and training needs, policy development and infrastructure improvements. The daily presence of MINUSTAH officers in all 16 of the country’s prisons has allowed for improvements across these priority areas, in particular at the local level. However, Haiti’s prisons continued to suffer from overcrowding, deficient management, excessive pretrial detention and food and water shortages. Improvements were noted with respect to the separation of minors in all but three prisons and in overall sanitary conditions. One of the Mission’s top priorities has been to support the office of the Director of the Prison Administration in developing standardized procedures and practices for the operation of the new prison in Croix des Bouquets. To date, 9 of the 12 proposed standard procedures have been officially signed by the Director of the Prison Administration. The remaining three directives will be presented to the Minister of Justice and the leadership of the Haitian National Police for final validation. During the reporting period, particular focus was directed towards the release of inmates in pretrial detention or those who had exceeded their sentences. As a result of MINUSTAH efforts, 269 detainees were liberated between September 2011 and January 2012. In addition, two MINUSTAH quick-impact projects were completed and contributed to better working and living conditions in two prisons in Les Cayes and Grande Rivière du Nord. Moreover, MINUSTAH provided field officer training to 42 national correctional officers on assessing the performance of new recruits in prisons.

"39. The Mission maintained its focus on the investigation and reporting of human rights violations. Through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in December 2011, MINUSTAH published two reports on alleged illegal killings by Haitian National Police officers and regretted that, despite some efforts by the police and judiciary to investigate the killings, there was a significant lack of capacity of the State to effectively prosecute and punish perpetrators. The Mission also closely monitored the trial of police and prison officers who were accused of illegal killings during the prison riot at Les Cayes on 19 January 2010. The trial resulted in the conviction of eight defendants and the acquittal of six others. On 30 January, the Haitian magistrate leading the investigation of former President Jean-Claude Duvalier stated that the statute of limitations blocked prosecution of the well-documented human rights crimes under the Duvalier regime and that Mr. Duvalier should face trial only on corruption charges. MINUSTAH publicly expressed regret over the decision. The Mission continued to advocate for and support State action to ensure accountability for human rights violations committed during the Duvalier regime. MINUSTAH also conducted a range of training programmes for local authorities and community leaders to build rule-of- law capacity, specifically on human rights, and provided support to the Office de la protection du citoyen.

"43. The work of the Mission’s Conduct and Discipline Unit focused on strengthening prevention measures, accelerating disciplinary case management, and taking remedial action, in line with the United Nations zero tolerance policy regarding misconduct by its personnel. During the reporting period, MINUSTAH responded to several cases of serious allegations of misconduct by Mission personnel. These cases include the alleged rape of a Haitian man in Port-Salut, the alleged rape of a minor in Gonaïves, and alleged sexual relations between Mission personnel and three minors in Port-au-Prince. As a result of these allegations, the Mission was confronted with protests in the Haitian public and among the political class against the alleged misconduct of Mission personnel. On 8 February, the Senate unanimously adopted a resolution requesting the Secretary-General to lift the protection of immunity of two MINUSTAH staff members allegedly involved in the case in Gonaïves. In all these cases, the Mission proactively responded by initiating internal investigations and taking swift disciplinary measures. In addition, the Mission conducted 51 training sessions on misconduct and the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse for a total of 1,265 MINUSTAH personnel in Port-au-Prince and several regions.

"45. MINUSTAH and the United Nations country team continued their efforts to develop and implement joint programmes. As of January 2012, 10 joint programmes were being implemented, for a total of $250 million, including 5 programmes funded through the Haiti Reconstruction Fund. These programmes addressed a wide range of recovery priorities, including debris removal, housing, health, return of the displaced to their neighbourhoods of origin or to safer housing, school meals, and environmental sustainability. United Nations country team members have three shared priorities: support to government institution-building, decentralization and gender equity. In pursuit of the first two priorities, in 2011, United Nations agencies deployed 419 national and 106 international personnel to national and local government entities to strengthen their capacity and provide technical assistance. Under MINUSTAH leadership, the Group of Twelve — the group of main donors in Haiti — has regularly met to accelerate progress and improve coordination in the recovery process, while also supporting the reactivation of key sector coordination groups (tables sectorielles) under the leadership of national ministries. Concurrently, the Group of Twelve is working with the Ministry of Planning and External Cooperation to reinforce the national aid coordination architecture and to develop an agreement outlining mutual responsibilities for strengthening public administration and national institutions. As of December 2011, the majority of humanitarian clusters were chaired or co-managed by Government entities. A key priority for the humanitarian country team in 2012 is the streamlining of humanitarian coordination structures to enhance the Government’s leadership role. Humanitarian actors are also developing the Government’s disaster preparedness and response capacity by supporting the National System of Disaster Risk Reduction in order to develop a multi-risk contingency plan in case of earthquake, flooding, hurricane or tsunami. 2011, the Integrated Strategic Framework for Haiti, which constitutes the main programming reference for MINUSTAH and United Nations agencies, has been extended until December 2012. The Integrated Strategic Framework is organized around five pillars, including institutional, territorial, economic and social rebuilding as well as an “enabling environment” pillar. Early in 2012, the United Nations system in Haiti began work on the development of a new Integrated Strategic Framework for the period 2013-2016, which will integrate humanitarian, development and stabilization priorities in alignment with the Government’s new plan, which derives directly from its Action Plan for National Recovery and Development of March 2010.

Under the leadership of the Ministry of Public Health and Population, a national cholera alert system has been established. Large-scale awareness campaigns and a nationwide network of treatment centres have led to an overall decrease in both infection and case fatality rates.

After the emergency response, MINUSTAH, United Nations agencies, humanitarian organizations and the Red Cross movement turned towards building national capacity for prevention and response to cholera in the Centre, Artibonite, West, North, North-East and North-West Departments. With UNICEF support, more than 1,400 trainers and 5,200 community workers were trained on hygiene promotion, with particular regard to cholera prevention. UNICEF continues to support, in partnership with the Ministry of Public Health and Population and the Inter-American Development Bank, 16 cholera treatment centres, 120 cholera treatment units and 1,172 oral rehydration community points. Supported by the United Nations Office for Project Services, door-to-door campaigns, social diagnostic surveys and theatrical performances also helped to sensitize more than 300,000 residents in 140 camps and neighbourhoods on cholera and on the importance of cleaning latrines.

By mid-July, the Mission had fully allocated the quick-impact budget of $7.5 million for the period 2011-2012, covering 177 projects, and closed all 229 projects from the fiscal year 2010-2011.

This included the organization in June of a national meeting, chaired by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, on the problem of excessive pretrial detention. MINUSTAH and UNDP continued to support the Ministry, including through the strengthening of the Judicial Inspectorate and the Ministry’s planning unit. In particular, UNDP supported a capacity development assessment of the Ministry, which resulted in an action plan for its institutional reform.

The support of UNDP in three regional pilot jurisdictions in Jacmel, Port-de-Paix and Fort-Liberté resulted in improved justice service delivery and decreased the levels of pretrial detention. UNDP and MINUSTAH jointly trained local magistrates, police officers and Prison Administration agents in investigation techniques and judicial identification in several regions. During the reporting period, MINUSTAH executed 17 quick-impact projects to construct and rehabilitate courts and provide them with office equipment. Meanwhile, 26 prefabricated units were installed for tribunals and civil registry offices throughout the country and the rehabilitation and equipping of the Institute of Forensic Medicine building was completed. The Mission also provided technical assistance in drafting a new legal basis for the Institute of Forensic Medicine. MINUSTAH and UNDP continued to provide technical assistance to the School of Magistrates, through which 20 magistrates who graduated from the initial training programme conducted in France were deployed to various jurisdictions as judges or prosecutors. The magistrates also benefited from an on-the-job training programme supported by UNDP, while MINUSTAH provided technical assistance to working groups preparing new criminal and criminal procedure codes.

"32. Notwithstanding the efforts to reduce the rate of illegal and prolonged pretrial detention by reviewing pending cases, which led to the release of numerous individuals, the growing number of new arrests has meant that the rate has remained high. As part of its programme aimed at improving correctional practices, MINUSTAH trained 105 Haitian corrections officers in the country’s 16 prisons. The mentoring and training provided to medical personnel notwithstanding, inmate death rates increased significantly, primarily as a result of the resurgence of cholera and tuberculosis. A total of 69 deaths from various causes were reported for the first half of 2012, compared to an annual total of 43 in 2011. MINUSTAH is working closely with health partners and the Prison Administration leadership to enhance health services, although the absence of qualified staff remains a significant challenge. MINUSTAH corrections officers have also been embedded in the Office of the Ombudsman and in the internal investigations branch of the national police, so as to raise awareness and increase capacity for intervention within the prison environment, in an effort to ensure that appropriate action is taken in cases of negligence and serious human rights violations. Efforts continued to build the capacity of the prison registration system, enabling the identification and release of procedures for correctional facilities by the Haitian authorities, MINUSTAH is working with the Prison Administration on their implementation. MINUSTAH completed the installation in eight prisons of prefabricated facilities to be used as administrative offices and inmate classrooms.

"33. The political stalemate and absence of a functioning Government in the early part of the reporting period constituted major obstacles to progress in the promotion and protection of human rights. The Mission maintained its focus on the investigation and reporting of human rights violations. In June 2012, it published a report on the inadequate response by the criminal justice sector to rape complaints filed in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area and issued recommendations on how victims of rape and other sexual crimes could better gain access to justice, which are also informing the Mission’s engagement with the authorities. The limited efforts by the police and judiciary to investigate the killings that were the subject of public MINUSTAH reports in 2011 have not achieved significant results. Political will is needed to advance efforts to combat impunity, in particular following the controversial statement by the Haitian magistrate leading the investigation of former President Jean-Claude Duvalier that the statute of limitations blocked prosecution of the well-documented human rights crimes under the Duvalier regime. MINUSTAH continues to conduct capacity-building and awareness-raising activities throughout the country. It has established good working relations with the Minister with special responsibility for promoting human rights and combating extreme poverty and has also provided assistance to the Office of the Ombudsman to prepare a law consistent with the Principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles). The law was adopted by Parliament in May and is awaiting promulgation by the President.

The Mission provided support to the Ministry of Women’s Affairs and Women’s Rights in running safe spaces for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence established in three camps for internally displaced persons, in addition to coordinating the creation of similar spaces in seven national police stations. The Mission, in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration, organized 28 training sessions for national police officers on police response to sexual and gender-based violence, in addition to 27 training sessions for Haitian legal professionals on legal recourse for victims of sexual violence. MINUSTAH held a five-day training-of-trainers session for 30 community leaders (20 women and 10 men) as part of a “zero violence” platform to support the establishment of community networks to raise awareness of how to prevent sexual and gender-based violence. The Mission supported advocacy campaigns that led to the adoption of the above-mentioned constitutional amendment providing for a quota of at least 30 per cent women’s participation in public decision-making. Support was also provided to women’s networks for the organization of 360 training and awareness-raising women and their communities that was officially submitted to the President by representatives of women’s organizations.

The reports are shared weekly with the national police Brigade for the Protection of Minors for follow-up. Concerning child trafficking, MINUSTAH briefed civilian agents of the Brigade and local communities against smuggling and trafficking of children at border posts with the Dominican Republic and established a hotline hosted by the Brigade to report child trafficking and other offences against children. After sustained advocacy by MINUSTAH and the juvenile justice sectoral group led by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security with the support of UNICEF, the juvenile court resumed hearings in June 2012 and has been processing most pending cases, 82 per cent of which involve minors in pretrial detention.

Radio MINUSTAH FM continued providing support to efforts to prevent cholera, ensure disaster and hurricane preparedness, and promote national reconciliation and the rule of law. In close coordination with other MINUSTAH components and United Nations agencies, the Mission produced its weekly 15-minute video programme on topics of interest to the Haitian public concerning its work and current affairs, which is broadcast on seven national television stations and eight diaspora television stations in the United States of America, in addition to being disseminated by the nine multimedia centres in the regions.

The number of joint programmes involving at least two United Nations agencies and the Government, which are managed by the United Nations country team, has increased to a total of 11, 6 of which are funded through the Haiti Reconstruction Fund.

"37. MINUSTAH has noted that the collection of evidence for prosecution is generally unsatisfactory, hampering the ability of the judicial authorities to investigate violent acts and prosecute criminals. An unusually high number of cases rely primarily or exclusively on confessions. To improve the quality of evidence available for prosecution, MINUSTAH has funded the reconstruction of the Forensics Institute. This will make it possible to conduct autopsies and eventually also include examinations of victims of non-homicidal crimes. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Public Health and Population and the Ministry of Justice and Public Security have not yet been able to render the Institute operational. An additional concern is the prosecution of certain high-profile criminals, which has been subject to political interference.

Regarding the independence of the judiciary, three laws adopted in 2007 have played a key role in the administration and regulation of the justice system, leading to the opening of the School of Magistrates and the first, and still only, juvenile tribunal outside the capital, both in 2009, and to the establishment of the Superior Council of the Judiciary in 2012, which will require continuing substantial support to allow it to fully play its role as the guardian of an independent and impartial judicial system.",46,data/pdfs\MINUSTAH_S_2017_840.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2017_840.pdf,MINUSTAH_S_2017_840,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The positions reserved for Kosovo Serbs in the municipal structures in Lipljan municipality (Pristina region) remained vacant, as no suitable candidate has applied. Two unions of Kosovo Serb- majority municipalities were formed, the first in northern Mitrovica and the second in eastern Kosovo. UNMIK has not recognized either union as a legitimate structure, as they are based on mono-ethnicity. The UNMIK administration in Mitrovica has made progress in establishing its administrative structure and in providing administration and public services in the northern part of Mitrovica city. Its staffing is almost complete with the recruitment and training of 82 new local staff members, bringing the total to 120.

Freedom of movement has also been hampered by the decision of the Serbian Government authorities not to sign an agreement on the use of Kosovo licence plates in Serbia proper and by their public calls for Kosovo Serbs not to register their cars with UNMIK. As a result, only 18 vehicles have been registered in northern Mitrovica since the beginning of the process on 29 April.

For example, the Minister of Public Services and General Secretary of the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) noted that the Kosovo Albanian public was not responsible for the violence and that responsibility for the events lay with Serbian politicians. The leader of PDK later publicly disavowed the Minister’s comments. A statement made by the Government, although relatively conciliatory in tone, assumed on the basis of unsubstantiated information that the drowning incident was caused by Serbs and was a result of intimidation based on inter-ethnic hatred.

In June, the Provisional Institutions also addressed a significant concern of displaced families, by committing themselves to allocating €2,000 for each family whose home was destroyed to cover the costs of replacing furniture and household items. The Reconstruction Commission is now undertaking an assessment regarding secondary buildings (such as sheds, workshops and barns), and will consider whether those structures will be included in the ongoing reconstruction effort at this stage.

On 1 October, the UNMIK Administration in Mitrovica, in a coordinated action with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Mercy Corps and the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian residents of the Česmin Lug camp in northern Mitrovica, closed and sealed off the camp. The electricity and water supply were cut and bulldozers were used to immediately remove the last standing shelters and barracks in order to dissuade any new arrivals from settling there. The remaining residents of the Česmin Lug camp and the UNMIK Administration in Mitrovica health house were moved to Camp Osterode. The site of the former Česmin Lug camp is now under the custody of UNMIK and the UNMIK Administration in Mitrovica with Kosovo police protection. Previously, some 50 new residential homes for members of the RAE communities were inaugurated in the Roma Mahala area in southern Mitrovica for returning families from Osterode and Česmin Lug.

During this year, the mission would include three broad programmes, as described above. The first programme, support for public administration and justice in Timor- Leste, would be advanced by UNMISET through provision of 58 civilian experts to the public administration and judiciary, and through continued assistance for justice in the area of serious crimes, at a level similar to the present, but with reallocation of some resources from investigative activity to promote timely completion of litigation at the trial and appellate level. The second programme, support for the development of law enforcement, would be advanced through retention of 157 civilian police advisers, under the leadership of a senior police adviser, who would undertake mentoring and capacity-building activities in Dili and in the districts. The third programme, support for the security and stability of Timor-Leste, would be effected through deployment of 42 military liaison officers, largely deployed along the tactical coordination line; retention of 310 formed military, including infantry, aviation and support; and deployment of an international response unit of 125 gendarmerie, who, with support from the formed military as required, would undertake preventive and response operations in exceptional circumstances, based on the authorization of my Special Representative.

Nevertheless, much remains to be done in key areas, from good governance and institution-building to security sector reform. The selection of the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice, the establishment and Timor-Leste and its neighbours are examples of the challenging tasks ahead.",62,data/pdfs\UNMISET_S_2004_888.pdf,UNMISET_S_2004_888.pdf,UNMISET_S2004_888,True,False,True,False,False,False,False
"64. The mission concluded that, despite the notable advances achieved during the UNMISET consolidation phase, Timor-Leste had not yet reached the critical threshold of self-sufficiency. The public administration — particularly the finance, banking and justice sectors — remains weak and fragile. Some of the 58 UNMISET civilian advisers who provide most critical support, and should by now be serving as mentors, continue to perform line functions in key institutions today. In the area of law enforcement, PNTL still faces serious formidable challenges, including a lack of professional skills and values, policing experience, necessary equipment and infrastructure, and management and coordination capabilities. Further training is essential to bring it up to the desired level of professionalism, competence and skills. The key role played by the UNMISET civilian police advisers in providing training and mentoring of PNTL remains indispensable. For training programmes currently under way to be fully implemented and completed by May 2005, it will be necessary to retain the authorized strength of 157 civilian police for the coming six months. With regard to support to the security and stability of Timor-Leste, the country’s border with Indonesia remains to be defined. While bilateral relations between Indonesia and Timor-Leste have improved, particularly at the highest level, the 42 military liaison officers are required to facilitate contacts between the border security agencies and to monitor security-related developments. This small international presence along the border, supported by the UNMISET military component, which has an authorized strength of 435, continues to be regarded as an important confidence-building mechanism by the Timorese population.",64,data/pdfs\UNMISET_S_2004_888.pdf,UNMISET_S_2004_888.pdf,UNMISET_S2004_888,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

I commend the efforts made by the Serious Crimes Unit to complete investigations by November 2004 and to conclude trials and other activities by May 2005 in accordance with Security Council resolution 1543 (2004). At the same time, I firmly believe that the perpetrators of the serious crimes committed in 1999 in East Timor should be brought to justice.

"11. Since my last report (S/2004/888), the eight transition working groups, which were constituted by my Special Representative in August 2004 to assess progress made in institutional capacity-building, identify Timor-Leste’s remaining assistance requirements and propose how best to meet them, have completed their work. In line with the request of the Security Council, in resolution 1573 (2004), for greater Timorese involvement and ownership of the three programme areas of the Mission’s mandate and at the request of UNMISET, the President, the Prime Minister and several Government ministers participated in and in some cases chaired various meetings of the working groups, which brought together representatives of the Government, UNMISET, United Nations agencies and Bretton Woods institutions, non-governmental organizations and other bilateral and multilateral partners. While the findings and conclusions of the working groups do not necessarily represent a consensus of all participants, they reflect an objective assessment of the key concerns remaining in the areas covered by the UNMISET mandate, namely the development of a professional police service, the deficiencies of the Timorese security sector and the overall capacity development of State and Government institutions, including the development of a functioning justice sector. Also addressed were the continuing requirements for enhancing transparency and accountability, the future of the serious crimes process and the need to support marginalized groups.",11,data/pdfs\UNMISET_S_2005_99.pdf,UNMISET_S_2005_99.pdf,UNMISET_S_2005_99,True,False,True,False,False,False,False

The transition working group on professional development of the national police also stressed the need for continued international assistance to build an independent, professional and competent police force, pointing, in particular, to the continued human rights abuses perpetrated by Timorese law-enforcement agents as well as the inadequate skills of the police force in various areas, especially the Border Patrol Unit. The transition working group on the roles and relationships of national security agencies noted that United Nations assistance would be required beyond May 2005 in order to develop a national security framework in which the respective roles of the armed forces and the national police are clearly defined.",12,data/pdfs\UNMISET_S_2005_99.pdf,UNMISET_S_2005_99.pdf,UNMISET_S_2005_99,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
"13. The transition working groups on institutional capacity-building of State administration and institution-building of the justice sector reviewed the need for the 58 “most critical” adviser positions, currently funded by UNMISET, beyond May 2005. The findings of the groups indicate that while local capacity has been built and institutional self-sufficiency greatly enhanced, there is still in some cases, especially in the legal and justice sectors, significant reliance on the international advisers to perform both line functions and to supervise the work of Timorese counterparts. In this connection, the retention of the 15 “most critical” adviser posts in the justice sector was considered vital to the continued functioning of the courts beyond May 2005, given the acute shortage of qualified national judges and the related need for Timorese judicial personnel to complete the two-and-a-half-year training programme.",13,data/pdfs\UNMISET_S_2005_99.pdf,UNMISET_S_2005_99.pdf,UNMISET_S_2005_99,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

With only the support of UNMISET civilian advisers, for example, Timorese officials have been able to develop a range of sector investment programmes which set out development objectives, policies and programmes for 17 key sectors, as well as related expenditure priorities for the period from June 2005 to August 2007.",16,data/pdfs\UNMISET_S_2005_99.pdf,UNMISET_S_2005_99.pdf,UNMISET_S_2005_99,False,False,True,False,False,False,False

In the case of the Treasury, the capacity of national staff to perform certain key routine tasks such as the closing of monthly and quarterly accounts, payroll operations and budget execution activities and to use computer software has been consolidated. It is expected that a national counterpart will be appointed shortly to the post of Director of the Treasury, currently filled by an UNMISET adviser.

As noted in my previous reports, the serious crimes process may not be able to fully respond to the desire for justice of those affected by the violence of 1999 within the limited time and resources that remain available. It is likely that a significant number of cases will not have been investigated or prosecuted by 20 May 2005. The indictments filed by the Serious Crimes Unit cover 572 of the estimated 1,400 murders committed in 1999. A number of cases, which have been referred to the Serious Crimes Unit by the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation, involve serious crimes and are thus deemed unsuitable for reconciliation processes. These cases have not yet been investigated. Formal legal processes are a crucial aspect of efforts to move beyond the violence that occurred in 1999. It is thus essential that all those responsible for the serious crimes committed in 1999 be held accountable, and that justice be done in the appropriate manner.

Moreover, the presence of military liaison officers will continue to be necessary, to facilitate necessary communication between the two parties, especially so long as a formal agreement on the border is not reached. In this context, it should be noted that the military liaison arrangement that is currently in effect between the Indonesian army and the UNMISET military component will end on 20 May 2005. A successor arrangement between Indonesia and Timor-Leste, under which the Tactical Coordination Line would remain in place but the Border Patrol Unit would replace the UNMISET military component, was presented to both sides in November 2004, but has not yet been endorsed by either Government. Should neither a final agreement on the demarcation of the land border, nor a border management agreement like the military liaison arrangement, be reached by 20 May 2005, there will be no legal framework to guide border normalization issues.

I would also like to record my deep appreciation to the people of Timor-Leste, who continue to forge ahead on their path towards peace, prosperity and development under their political leadership. Their commitment to democracy, the rule of law and human rights is a timely reminder of what a determined people can achieve with the support of the international community.

"6. Concurrent with these high-level activities, community-level dialogue progressed under the Government-led “Simu-Malu” (“to receive each other”) programme and the President’s Dialogue Commission. These community-based activities, which were principally held in Dili, were aimed at facilitating the reintegration of internally displaced persons and addressing the societal fragmentation that followed the east-west violence and inter-gang fighting in various neighbourhoods, particularly around the internally displaced persons’ camps. These activities were supported by UNMIT and United Nations agencies, with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ensuring coordination with international and national non-governmental organizations and the international security forces that are deployed by Australia and New Zealand to Timor-Leste in response to the requests of the Government (“the international security forces”).

My Special Representative and the UNMIT leadership used political good offices with the Timorese leaders to support the emerging dialogue between and among the political leaders, the national security and defence forces, political parties and other relevant actors. In addition to attending relevant meetings and events, they coordinated with others supporting the national reconciliation efforts, in particular the Special Envoy of the Government of Norway and representatives of the Club of Madrid. In using its good offices, UNMIT focused on bringing together the Timorese body politic in preparation for the submission of and the follow-up to the report of the Independent Special Commission of Inquiry (see para. 18 below), as well as on bridging gaps between the various parties on security matters and electoral issues. To ensure regular communication and coordination at the highest levels between the President, the Government, Parliament and UNMIT on all areas related to the Mission’s mandate, a Committee on High-Level Coordination was established.

"10. In addition, the armed group led by fugitive F-FDTL Military Police Commander Major Alfredo Reinado, who escaped from Becora Prison with 56 others on 30 August, continued to be a cause for concern, not only because it symbolized the prevailing sense of impunity, but also because of the prospect that the issue could be used politically in the electoral campaign. The F-FDTL Command took steps on behalf of the Government to initiate a dialogue with Major Reinado aimed at bringing about the cantonment of his armed group in order to reduce the potential for security problems and enable the judicial process to proceed. A first meeting between the Commander of the F-FDTL, Brigadier General Taur Matan Ruak, and Major Reinado was held on 21 December. At the request of the President, the Prime Minister and the President of Parliament at the high-level coordination meeting on 10 January 2007, a tripartite delegation was established to engage in a dialogue with Major Reinado.

The report of the Commission (S/2006/822, annex) was first submitted to me, then presented to the Parliament on 17 October and subsequently widely distributed in the country. The UNMIT leadership prepared politically for the release of the report by providing accurate information and clarification on the Commission’s mandate and the status of its work to relevant institutions and interested parties, as well as to the public. In addition, in view of widespread speculation of possible negative reactions after the report’s release, UNMIT, together with the international security forces, undertook the necessary security preparations.

"22. A number of judicial proceedings in relation to the events of April-May 2006, some of which had been initiated before the release of the Commission report, were ongoing. The trial of former Minister of Interior, Rogerio Lobato, charged with embezzlement, the unlawful use of weapons in the disruption of public order, manslaughter and attempted manslaughter, and three co-defendants charged with unauthorized possession of a firearm, commenced on 30 November 2006. It was immediately adjourned because of the absence of one of the co-defendants. On 28 December, a number of shots were allegedly fired by unknown persons at the house of one of the main witnesses in this trial. In response, witness protection measures were put in place by UNMIT police. The trial resumed on 9 January 2007. Despite the presence of more than 800 demonstrators in support of the former Minister on the first day of the trial, proceedings on that and following days went smoothly. On 12 January 2007, the Dili District Court remanded three members of the F-FDTL and one PNTL officer into preventive detention in relation to the shooting of unarmed PNTL officers on 25 May 2006, which had caused the death of eight PNTL officers and injury to 25 other officers and two UNOTIL police. One PNTL Deputy District Commander and two PNTL officers are awaiting trial in detention for illegal possession of firearms, while one civilian, initially placed in pre-trial detention on a murder charge, was conditionally released by the court and ordered to report weekly to the police while awaiting trial. UNMIT regularly monitored the judicial proceedings and provided security as needed. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri remained under investigation by the Prosecutor-General in relation to alleged distribution of weapons, but without charges having been brought against him.

The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) provided support on critical issues related to children, including in the areas of community policing, strengthening of the Vulnerable Persons Unit and juvenile justice, on which it worked extensively with the Ministry of Justice, including on the drafting of the children’s code and other legislative instruments to strengthen compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child.",25,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2007_50.pdf,UNMIT_S_2007_50.pdf,UNMIT_S_2007_50,False,False,False,False,False,False,True
"27. The challenges confronting the judicial system outlined in my previous report (see S/2006/628, paras. 81-88) continued to impede its effective functioning. In recent months, arrests in Dili, in particular, have created an additional backlog of cases. The capacity of the judicial system promptly to deal with its backlog and with the growing number of cases is limited, requiring it to prioritize the most serious crimes. A large number of those arrested for lesser offences were released by judicial authorities owing to capacity limitations as well as to technical deficiencies in the submission of case files. Increasingly, reports of intimidation of witnesses and the absence of mechanisms for witness protection are hampering prosecutions. These factors, coupled with a general lack of understanding among the population about judicial procedures have contributed to a growing perception that impunity is tolerated. UNMIT and UNDP are working with national authorities to overcome these bottlenecks and to facilitate longer-term capacity-building within the justice system institutions, including through UNDP’s justice support programme. This programme will require additional donor funding, however, if it is to further expand its activities to respond to evolving needs.

UNMIT absorbed 24 police officers from the previous United Nations Mission (United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL)) as the initial nucleus for its police component. Subsequently, police officers who had served with the international security forces transferred to UNMIT, starting with individual officers and formed police units from Portugal and Malaysia, and continuing with those from Australia. In parallel, additional police officers and formed police units were deployed to UNMIT so that, by the end of December, the Mission had 1,070 police officers on the ground, including 427 in three formed police units from Bangladesh, Malaysia and Portugal.

"30. While the overall security situation has remained volatile, the trend has been towards increasingly longer periods of calm and fewer outbreaks of violence, due, in part, to the increased presence and numbers of UNMIT police officers in communities throughout all districts of the country, including internally displaced persons’ camps, where they work with approximately 250 screened PNTL officers and rely on the close support of the international security forces, as needed. Civil disturbance incidents in Dili have decreased from an average of 20 to 30 daily in September and October, to 10 to 15 from November through January. Those averages need to be seen, however, in the light of spikes in violence that have occurred and which could continue to be triggered at any time, for example when the UNMIT police had to defuse 49 rock-fighting incidents in a single day on 24 October, or when violent incidents, street fighting and house burning suddenly UNMIT’s establishment in late August, 295 cases have been referred to the PNTL National Investigation Department, including 53 murders, 37 attempted murders, 26 serious assaults and 45 arson incidents, 10 rapes and two sexual assaults of minors. Of those cases, 256 occurred in Dili and 39 in the rest of the country. This led to 46 arrests. As regards the 57 inmates, including Major Reinado, who escaped from Becora prison on 30 August, only two convicted prisoners from this group surrendered to the UNMIT police and are back in prison, while the remaining escapees, who were pre-trial detainees, are still at large and remain a serious security concern.",30,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2007_50.pdf,UNMIT_S_2007_50.pdf,UNMIT_S_2007_50,False,True,False,False,False,False,False
"31. As had been the case from the onset of the crisis in early 2006, Dili has remained the main centre of incidents of violence, and security is still fragile in various neighbourhoods of the city. The earlier east/west-based violence in Dili, which had resulted in a number of deaths, serious injuries and burning of houses, on occasion involving persons in internally displaced persons’ camps and in the surrounding areas, decreased over the reporting period. On the other hand, localized violence increased between neighbourhood youth gangs and members of rival martial arts groups, largely confined to Dili but with occasional incidents in other districts. Rocks, machetes and iron darts continued to be the most commonly used weapons in such gang-fights, in some cases causing deaths or serious injuries. Of growing concern were a few incidents in which firearms and hand-grenades were used. Nevertheless, the overall level of violence has decreased in recent months, in part due to the increase in dialogue initiatives in Dili as well as intensified community-policing efforts of UNMIT, the establishment of additional police posts in troubled areas and the installation of a toll-free national emergency line, all of which facilitated increased police responsiveness. In addition, Prime Minister Ramos-Horta and other local leaders as well as UNMIT police, made increased efforts to bring together martial arts groups to peacefully settle their differences, to discourage violence and to work towards improvement in the security situation.",31,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2007_50.pdf,UNMIT_S_2007_50.pdf,UNMIT_S_2007_50,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Subsequently, starting at the end of November, small numbers of UNMIT police deployed to the 12 districts outside of Dili, where they worked together in co- location with PNTL officers who remained operational throughout and following the crisis. The nationwide presence of UNMIT police officers enhanced their understanding of the security situation in the districts and helped to pre-empt some tense situations from escalating into violence, as evidenced by the prevention of large-scale fighting between rival martial arts groups in Maubisse in early January. In order to encourage cooperation from the local communities and promote a better, understanding of its initiatives and activities, UNMIT police, in collaboration with the UNMIT Public Information Office, disseminated information on police operations through press conferences as well as daily radio and regular television broadcasts.

Two-hundred and seventy-six PNTL officers completed the Police Academy’s provisional certification course and, as no allegations of criminal acts or human rights violations came to the attention of UNMIT, they returned to active duty without firearms under the mentorship of UNMIT police. During the screening process, 342 PNTL officers were identified as requiring further investigation. The remaining Dili-based PNTL officers are still going through the screening process. About 2,000 PNTL officers deployed in the districts will undergo the screening process in the coming months. In response to a request from the Timorese Government, screening of PNTL members of the Rapid Intervention Unit was given priority to ensure the co-location of screened and re-trained officers from this Unit with UNMIT formed police units before the elections.

UNMIT representatives at that meeting noted that there were still apprehensions concerning the F-FDTL among some sectors of society and that not all findings of the Commission of Inquiry concerning F-FDTL had been addressed. They urged that “normalization” proceed cautiously and in close coordination with the international security forces in the country. The Government undertook to share an action plan setting out the steps of the “normalization” of F-FDTL. The Mission is awaiting receipt of the plan. Nevertheless, since that date, armed F-FDTL soldiers have been increasingly present in public, including near the Dili District Court on 12 January during a preliminary hearing related to a number of F-FDTL soldiers.

It is expected that the ongoing UNMIT assessment of PNTL and the Ministry of Interior, and the plans to reconstitute PNTL and strengthen the Ministry of Interior, will feed into the security sector review.

In addition to focusing on enhancing institutional systems, skills and attitudes within each organ of sovereignty, these projects seek to promote a balance and separation of powers as enshrined in the constitution. Some of the immediate priorities of these projects are continued strengthening of the justice sector as well as oversight institutions, including support to the Office of the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice and civil society organizations. Agreement has been reached between the Government of Timor-Leste and UNDP to provide, with donor support, technical support for enhancing transparency and anti-corruption measures.

At the beginning of November, the Prime Minister and the then acting Special Representative co-chaired a national retreat on the situation of internally displaced persons, which led to a general consensus among the Ministries, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations that efforts to assist internally displaced persons to return to their homes in Dili or to relocate to other suitable areas should be increased. As a result, an operational plan for durable solutions to internal displacement was prepared to support the return and reintegration process. However, as of January 2007, around 100,000 persons remain displaced, although these numbers fluctuate. In June 2006, internally displaced persons were almost evenly distributed between Dili and the districts, but since then there has been a shift from Dili to the districts, with an estimated 29,000 persons remaining in camps in Dili and the rest staying with host families in the districts and in internally displaced persons’ camps in Baucau. The onset of the rainy season in December aggravated the situation in the camps. The international community assisted the Government in identifying and setting up alternative emergency shelter sites for internally displaced persons staying in high-risk camps. As at 31 January 2007, general food distribution to internally displaced persons in camps in Dili district will come to an end and will be replaced by food assistance on the basis of assessed vulnerabilities.

These meetings will continue, including with those parties that did not obtain seats in Parliament but together received around 10 per cent of the votes. UNMIT also facilitated district-level political accords and community dialogues in specific districts where there had been security problems. In addition, numerous dialogue initiatives emerged in communities that experienced security problems during the electoral process, reflecting the desire of the Timorese people to settle conflicts peacefully.

UNMIT and United Nations agencies supported several initiatives to ensure an inclusive approach to the elections. The United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) tailored components of the voter education programme to address women voters. With support from UNIFEM, a Timorese women’s organization monitored political party programmes to assess commitments to women’s rights and gender equality, and offered support to women in political parties, resulting in the signing of a women’s political platform by 12 of the parties.

"41. UNMIT continued to provide advice to the Government on key governance issues such as the balance of powers between the organs of sovereignty, the need for an effective parliamentary opposition, decentralization and local governance and the electoral process. In addition, UNDP and other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes as well as development partners have well-established projects in the governance area. UNDP prepared, in cooperation with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, an induction programme for new parliamentarians. UNDP advisers also provided on-the-job training and mentoring to the Parliament’s secretariat staff in such areas as administration and committee support. The decentralization process was supported by UNDP and the United Nations Capital Development Fund, and pilot local assemblies in four districts were supplied with necessary equipment and technical support. The Office of the Prime Minister for the Promotion of Equality, with assistance from UNIFEM, supported dialogue initiatives involving 727 women to develop linkages between leaders and community support structures for women’s leadership. UNDP also supported the Ministry of State Administration in developing the personnel information management system, the first phase of which is scheduled for completion by the end of August 2007.",41,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2007_513.pdf,UNMIT_S_2007_513.pdf,UNMIT_S_2007_513,False,False,False,False,True,False,False
"46. With the exception of the electoral support area, I do not envision any change to the current mandate. The security situation in Timor-Leste improved overall during the reporting period but continues to be volatile and subject to spikes in violence, such as the serious disturbances that erupted following the 6 August announcement of the new Government. While screened and certified national police officers are increasingly assuming responsibilities alongside their UNMIT police counterparts, they still require extensive training and further institutional development of the national police force is needed. On occasions when security incidents suddenly increased, as in August, it was UNMIT police officers, particularly those in formed policed units, who were most effective in responding quickly and containing the incidents. Thus, I recommend strongly that four of the Mission’s five formed police units be maintained at least until the end of the current mandate, taking account of the continued presence of the international security forces.",46,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2007_513.pdf,UNMIT_S_2007_513.pdf,UNMIT_S_2007_513,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

Electoral and public information officers conducted voter education and outreach activities, covering even remote villages, and ensured that the public was fully informed of the process. Regional public information officers continued their capacity-building efforts with district-based media. Regional political officers were instrumental in reporting on political and security developments in the districts, undertaking good offices efforts vis-à-vis the local authorities, political parties and civil society, as well as providing advice to UNMIT police. Regional human rights officers reported on the human rights situation and conducted other human rights activities in areas where there was a limited presence of civil society organizations carrying out such activities. The continued need for them is reinforced by the fact that the Office of the Provedor has not yet established regional branches. It is therefore recommended that UNMIT maintain the four regional offices, at the same level, until the end of the current mandate.",52,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2007_513.pdf,UNMIT_S_2007_513.pdf,UNMIT_S_2007_513,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
"55. There can be no enduring reconciliation without justice, and it is critical that a culture of impunity not be allowed to establish itself in Timor-Leste. All recommendations in the Commission of Inquiry report should be expeditiously implemented, including through the formal judicial process. Some progress has been made; however, additional measures need to be taken, such as the passage of a law on the protection of witnesses and adequate provision of personnel for the Prosecutor-General’s office. More generally, weaknesses in the judicial sector undermine public confidence in other rule of law institutions, including the police. The recent swearing-in of 27 judges, prosecutors and defenders is a positive step towards increasing the justice system’s capacity. UNMIT, together with other international partners, will continue to support the judicial sector, as well as other efforts to strengthen human rights and the rule of law.

This will be done within the context of wider security sector reform, which will be a continuing UNMIT priority. In the meantime, UNMIT police will continue to be responsible for the maintenance of public security, which will require retaining, for the time being, four formed police units in the country. The international security forces have also played an invaluable security role, including in support of UNMIT. UNMIT’s military liaison officers, who have contributed to the stable border situation, will focus more on liaison with the international security forces and the Timorese armed forces. UNMIT will rely on a small number of electoral advisers to continue assistance to the Technical Secretariat for Electoral Administration and the National Electoral Commission.

These three district administrations, supported by UNMIT, the national police and the armed forces, as well as international security forces, responded with a series of dialogue initiatives to bring opposing stakeholders together.

The incidence of serious crimes such as murder, abduction and rape also decreased, from about nine per month during the previous reporting period to about five in the current period. This positive trend is due in large part to the strategic approaches adopted by the UNMIT police and the national police of improved information gathering, targeted patrolling of problem areas and community policing to prevent crimes, with special attention given to areas identified as particularly volatile. For example, from 21 to 24 November, following information received locally, the UNMIT police, working alongside national police officers and assisted by the international security forces, successfully conducted a weapons recovery operation in Dili’s troublesome Bairo Pite area.

"22. During recent months, UNMIT encountered increasing challenges to the mentoring process for the national police. Some police officers, especially in the districts, have resisted supervision and mentoring by UNMIT police as they consider themselves ready to assume increased operational responsibilities, although the majority of officers have been cooperative and are willing to undergo all requirements of the certification process. Further, a number of Timorese leaders, including the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Security and the General Commander Designate of the national police, have publicly raised concerns regarding the pace of the certification process and have appealed for increased operational tasks to be given to national police officers as well as accelerated handover of policing responsibilities in the districts. In addition, some concerns have been raised regarding the inadequate number of UNMIT police with appropriate training skill sets. police to conduct mentoring. The relatively low number of UNMIT police officers deployed in the districts, particularly in remote areas, makes mentoring there more difficult than in Dili. The high turnover of UNMIT police officers through rotation further affects mentoring efforts, although comprehensive mentoring guidelines have been developed for uniformity in approach. Also, given the focus on the task of maintaining security during the elections, most police officers deployed to UNMIT had operational, rather than training and mentoring, experience. Efforts are being made to enhance UNMIT police capacities to provide training and mentoring for the national police, including through an augmented training-of-trainers approach and by requesting contributing countries to deploy more officers with specialized training and mentoring skills. In addition, an independent ongoing evaluation of the Vulnerable Persons Unit of the national police, supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), has highlighted the need for deploying additional officers to UNMIT with training and experience in dealing with gender-based crimes, particularly given the Unit’s critical role in protecting women and children who continue to bear the brunt of the violence. Of course, further efforts are needed to address gender-based violence at all levels, including through training of all national police and UNMIT police officers on the special needs of women and investigative techniques for gender-based crimes as well as through improving victim access to judicial recourse.",22,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2008_26.pdf,UNMIT_S_2008_26.pdf,UNMIT_S_2008_26,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
"25. In view of progress in the registration, screening and training of national police officers, UNMIT has started to discuss with the Government the process of the phased transfer of law enforcement responsibility to the national police, although there are particular concerns regarding its still weak logistical capabilities (including lack of sufficient facilities, vehicles and communication equipment). In accordance with the policing arrangement, and the reform, restructuring and rebuilding plan being negotiated with the Government, the schedule for handover depends on the status of (a) the certification programme; (b) the achievement of benchmarks and performance targets set out in the reform, restructuring and rebuilding plan; and (c) the security situation. Taking account of these factors, a phased handover of districts and/or special police units is projected to begin in April 2008, with the Rapid Intervention Unit likely to be the first unit to be declared fully operational. Thereafter, depending on progress, it is envisaged that handover could proceed at the rate of one district every two months, starting with Dili district. The schedule will also take account of the outcome of a “pilot handover” of three police substations in Dili to commence in January 2008. However, some UNMIT police officers will be required to remain in handed-over districts in order to provide continuing advice and support to the national police officers and to liaise with and report to UNMIT police headquarters in Dili. assisting the UNMIT police and the national police in the maintenance of law and order in the eastern districts during and after the August 2007 unrest, and by maintaining static security at some key installations in Dili. Nevertheless, in some instances, Timorese soldiers assuming static security tasks fired warning shots in violation of the rules of engagement, and occasional disputes emerged between individual military and police members. The armed forces command was responsive when UNMIT raised concerns regarding these incidents. However, their occurrence highlights the need to further improve relations between the security forces as well as to strengthen institutional policies and procedures appropriate for a military force in a peacetime setting, as part of a holistic approach to security sector reform. In order to help address some of these concerns, in December UNMIT initiated training for armed forces personnel on national and international human rights standards, principles regarding the use of force, and command responsibility to ensure respect for human rights standards.

However, the report also emphasized that considerable challenges remained to be addressed to ensure the safeguarding of human rights, including, inter alia, ensuring adequate standards of living (e.g., housing, basic services and employment), combating domestic and gender-based violence, and creating conditions for the voluntary and peaceful return of internally displaced persons. The need for increased access to justice and protection of the population in the districts, and for strengthened accountability for cases of misconduct among the security forces, was also highlighted.

This facilitated the admission of the Office of the Provedoria to the Asia-Pacific Forum for National Human Rights Institutions in September 2007. The Office of the Provedoria organized a human rights monitoring mission to Viqueque subdistricts, and also presented a monitoring analysis with recommendations for improving conditions in police detention centres in Dili.

With the aim of strengthening the country’s system of checks and balances, UNDP continued to provide support to the Office of the President to increase its effectiveness, including through the development of processes to improve its agenda management and coordination and communications capacities. In October, UNMIT and UNDP undertook a joint organizational analysis mission to support the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Advice was provided to the Parliament by UNMIT and through the UNDP parliament support project, which deployed four legal advisers who helped the new parliamentarians during critical legislative processes, including those leading to approval of the Government programme and the 2007 transitional and 2008 State budgets. UNDP and the United Nations Capital Development Fund continued to support Government strategies for local governance, including the completion of national consultations on the reorganization of administrative structures.

Given the continuing fragile environment in Timor-Leste and the level of confidence among the Timorese population in their security institutions, one of the most critical institutions warranting sustained assistance is the national police service. Despite considerable progress in the screening and mentoring process, the national police force requires further training, institutional development and strengthened capacities to be in a position to assume full responsibility for dealing with potentially volatile security situations. UNMIT police officers, particularly those in formed police units, have continued to be required to respond to group fighting and public disturbances, and have in large part contributed to the relatively stable security situation and the drop in serious criminal offences, with the support of the international security forces. The daily occurrence of public disturbances, however, further highlights the need for a continued UNMIT police presence to perform interim law enforcement until the national police force is fully reconstituted.",57,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2008_26.pdf,UNMIT_S_2008_26.pdf,UNMIT_S_2008_26,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

On 23 April, in his first major public address after his return to Timor-Leste, the President emphasized the importance of dialogue and utilizing the experiences and skills of all Timorese leaders to address issues of national concern. He specifically called on the Government to work together with Fretilin as “the party with the most votes”. Expanded meetings of the High-level Coordination Committee (see para. 9 above), now including the Fretilin leadership, are a constructive step towards gaining a broad national consensus on major issues facing the country. My Special Representative has continued to facilitate and support such inclusive approaches, and maintains weekly meetings with the Secretary-General of Fretilin.

It does, however, continue to label the Government, formed by the Aliança com Maioria Parlamentar (AMP) led by the Prime Minister, as an unconstitutional “de facto government” (see S/2007/513, para. 4). The overtures made by Fretilin to the Associação Social-Democrata Timorense (ASDT), a member of the AMP coalition, to form an alliance, did not succeed in the end in weakening the coalition, but contributed to plunging ASDT into a public leadership battle.

In practice, however, UNMIT police were not informed when and for how long individual officers would be participating in Joint Command operations, creating difficulties for the certification process and operational planning.

At the helipad in Dili, about a dozen F-FDTL members armed with long-barrelled weapons forced UNMIT police to hand over the suspect. On 28 February, F-FDTL elements arrested a man for allegedly throwing a stone at their vehicle and brought the suspect to the Dili Police Watch House where, shortly afterwards, members of the Joint Command arrived and beat up the suspect, levelling firearms at an UNMIT police officer when he tried to prevent the assault.",17,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2008_501.pdf,UNMIT_S_2008_501.pdf,UNMIT_S_2008_501,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The incidence of serious crimes such as murder, abduction and rape also decreased, from about five per month during the previous reporting period to about four in the current period. This positive trend is due in large part to the UNMIT and national police approach of targeted patrolling of problem areas, special attention being given to areas identified as particularly volatile, as well as to the restrictions on movements imposed by the curfews.

As indicated in my previous report (S/2008/26, para. 58), in mid-March an expert mission led by the United Nations Police Adviser visited the country and issued a report that made comprehensive recommendations (see S/2008/329) on policing and broader rule of law and security sector reform issues. Subsequently, at of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, with support from the International Center for Transitional Justice, were deployed to UNMIT for eight weeks starting on 23 May to assist with the implementation of the expert mission’s recommendations. With this support, strategies were developed in close consultation with the Secretary of State for Security and the national police to establish a timetable for the national police’s resumption of policing responsibilities. This would be based on the three phases of reconstitution described in the Policing Arrangement, recognizing that the initial phase has been completed. During the second, consolidation phase, initial planning envisages that there will be a gradual resumption of policing responsibilities by the national police in specified districts and units starting in August 2008, to be completed in the first half of 2009. The calendar for the resumption of responsibility was developed by UNMIT in close consultation with the leadership of the national police and the Timorese Government. It will be adjusted by carefully assessing the state of readiness of the national police using five criteria: (a) the security environment; (b) staffing levels of certified officers; (c) the availability of initial operational logistical requirements; (d) institutional stability; and (e) mutual respect between F-FDTL and the national police.",21,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2008_501.pdf,UNMIT_S_2008_501.pdf,UNMIT_S_2008_501,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

The resumption of responsibility by the national police will be facilitated through a revised and streamlined mentoring programme, with mandatory training focusing on core competencies, developed and implemented jointly by UNMIT police and national police officers.

It will lay the groundwork for the long-term process of developing an impartial and professional police service. It is, therefore, not proposed that the UNMIT police draw down their presence during the resumption of responsibilities by the national police. Rather, the UNMIT police will continue to play a crucial role of monitoring and reporting from all districts, while also being available to provide advice, as well as offer operational support and, in extremis, assume interim law enforcement responsibilities, if required and requested.

"38. Despite the best efforts of the Government and its partners, Timor-Leste has not experienced significant progress in poverty alleviation or in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals since the restoration of its independence in 2002. Per capita income in the non-oil economy is about 20 per cent lower than it was in 2002, implying that poverty is increasing. Public investments need to increase in the non-oil-and-gas sectors if the economy is to experience real growth over the next several years. Some of this investment could well come from the Petroleum Fund. Taking the low level of budget execution into consideration and without changing the fundamental operation or sustainability of the Fund, ways of “front-loading” expenditures from the Petroleum Fund to help promote sustainable economic growth and alleviate poverty need to be considered. UNMIT and its United Nations partners have been advocating a prudent, sustainable approach to the management of Timor-Leste’s petroleum wealth, within the framework of a Government-led poverty reduction programme.

This includes $240 million for an economic stabilization fund to mitigate potential domestic problems resulting from global price increases. Meanwhile, Timor-Leste’s oil revenues have been increasing as a result of the continuing increase in the price of oil, leading the Government to review the estimated sustainable income of the Petroleum Fund, bearing in mind current capacity constraints that affect budget execution. It may therefore be necessary for the Government to consider outsourcing in key areas where capacities are lacking.

During the meeting held on 3 April, the Prime Minister launched the 2009 Millennium Development Goals report on Timor-Leste, which highlights the fact that further steps are required for the country to achieve the Goals. As the report indicates that in 2007 half of the population lived on less than $0.88 per day, it is critical that the Government continue its efforts to strengthen programmes to achieve the Millennium Development goal of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger.",40,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2009_504.pdf,UNMIT_S_2009_504.pdf,UNMIT_S_2009_504,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
"49. Continued incremental progress has been achieved towards the priority benchmarks developed to cover the four mandated priority areas of UNMIT: review and reform of the security sector; strengthening of the rule of law; promotion of a culture of democratic governance and dialogue; and economic and social development (see S/2009/72, para. 47, and annex). UNMIT and the United Nations country team developed an integrated strategic framework that outlines goals and activities in support of the realization of the benchmarks. As regards the first priority benchmark, relating to the strengthening of security sector institutions, various laws and regulations have been promulgated, including on police promotion, salaries and service structures (see para. 22 above). Other laws approved by the Council of Ministers are under consideration by Parliament, such as the draft national security, internal security and national defence laws. The resumption of primary policing responsibilities by the national police also indicated progress in the sector (see para. 20 above).",49,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2009_504.pdf,UNMIT_S_2009_504.pdf,UNMIT_S_2009_504,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
"50. Regarding the second priority benchmark, relating to outstanding investigations and enhancing the functioning of the judiciary, some progress was achieved on serious crimes investigations and on the implementation of the recommendations of the Special Commission of Inquiry (see para. 30 above). An independent, comprehensive needs assessment of the justice sector is under way. Once completed, the review and implementation of its recommendations, in liaison with the Timorese authorities and in conjunction with the strategic plan for the justice sector (see para. 36 above), will provide further momentum towards reaching this benchmark. With respect to the third priority benchmark, on adherence to the values and principles of sustainable democratic governance through respect for Constitutional rights and guarantees for all citizens and to ethical standards, the Government has sought at various levels to ensure strict ethical standards (see para. 12 above) and to enhance respect for the rule of law (see paras. 36 and 37 above). The fourth priority benchmark refers to improved quality of life and increased employment opportunities, especially focusing on rural areas and young people and the sustainable return and reintegration of internally displaced persons. The Government, with the support of UNMIT and the United Nations country team, made concerted efforts to improve basic social services and livelihoods (e.g., in the areas of education, health and nutrition, child protection), reduce poverty and create additional employment opportunities (see paras. 38, and 41-44 above).

"51. Many other efforts have been made by the Government, UNMIT and other partners to achieve the benchmarks. For example, within the security sector, new F-FDTL recruitment began, and UNMIT is facilitating discussions between the Secretary of State for Defence and bilateral partners for further development of F-FDTL. The Ministry of Defence and Security is recruiting 12 civil servants for procurement and asset management. On 7 July, Parliament approved amendments to the law on liberation combatants, making more veterans eligible for pension payments. Regarding the judiciary, the rule of law and human rights, a bimonthly informal donor forum was established with the diplomatic community for policy discussion on assistance to the justice sector, in particular with a view to addressing gaps and overlaps. The new criminal code came into effect, and the courts made efforts to improve the number of decisions taken in civil cases to avoid an increase in the number of those pending.

My Special Representative will continue his good-offices efforts to promote constructive political dialogue and facilitate unity of effort among all political actors on important national issues. Public statements by and the actions of various political actors demonstrating respect for the rule of law and the institutions of State, as well as the ability of the governing AMP coalition and the opposition to jointly support some legislation in Parliament, have been encouraging. While the exchange of differing opinions is an integral element of multiparty democracy, such discourse should be constructively conducted and not exploited to heighten tensions in society.

The provisions contained in the package of draft legislation currently being considered by Parliament which are aimed at upholding human rights, the rule of law and civilian oversight are commendable. However, defining a meaningful role for F-FDTL in a peacetime setting, clarifying its relationship with the national police and establishing accountability mechanisms and civilian oversight will be among the main challenges for the Government in seeking consensus on and implementing such legislation. As my Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Security Sector Support and Rule of Law has shared with various Timorese interlocutors, the draft legislation’s proposed dealing with crisis situations must clearly articulate the different roles and responsibilities of F-FDTL and the national police, in conformity with the Constitution of Timor-Leste. Given the importance of promoting awareness among the general public on the key issues raised by the draft security legislation, it is encouraging that the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and National Security is planning to hold public hearings in Baucau, Oecussi and Maliana.",56,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2009_504.pdf,UNMIT_S_2009_504.pdf,UNMIT_S_2009_504,True,False,False,False,False,True,False

The steady and deliberate pace of the resumption of primary policing responsibilities by the national police force reflects the serious consideration given to the criteria developed jointly by UNMIT and the Timorese authorities. This approach, which is not bound by a pre-determined, artificial timeline, is necessary for the sustainable and long-term development of the institution as well as to avoid a recurrence of the systematic failures that affected the police service in 2006. Continued monitoring by UNMIT police in those districts and units that resume responsibilities will be critical to ensuring the implementation of policies and procedures; assessing institutional capabilities to deal with disciplinary and human rights violations; and identifying further measures needed for strengthening the development of the national police, as well as trends. In conjunction with this monitoring role, there is a need to maintain the capability of UNMIT police to assume, in extremis, interim law enforcement, if requested and required. I commend the Government’s efforts to date, in keeping with its responsibilities under the certification process, to remove officers deemed unsuitable for police service.

In all of these meetings, UNMIT encouraged the adoption of decisions that reinforce the foundations of long-term stability and the strengthening of democratic governance, provided constructive feedback on the implementation of such decisions, and made available the United Nations good offices and resources as necessary to facilitate their implementation.",7,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2009_72.pdf,UNMIT_S_2009_72.pdf,UNMIT_S_2009_72,False,False,False,False,False,False,True
"9. President Ramos-Horta has made laudable efforts to create opportunities for the opposition to make contributions to issues of national interest. On 9 October, in an address to the Parliament, the President called for the opposition to be included in the management arrangements for the economic stabilization fund. Subsequently, on 21 November, the President convened a meeting with the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of Fretilin at which they agreed to continue regular discussions every three weeks. On 19 November, the Office of the President signed a memorandum of understanding with the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue for a dialogue process to achieve consensus on issues of national importance. These were important initiatives to reinforce consultative approaches. My Special Representative supported these initiatives, including by reminding the political leaders of their commitment to ensure a meaningful role for the opposition, as set out in the political party accord signed on 25 May 2007 (see S/2007/513, para. 7). Dialogue and reconciliation efforts also continued at the local level. Seven Government dialogue teams (five in Dili and two in the districts) were established with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). As at 31 December, the teams had successfully facilitated 45 preparatory meetings, building up to 16 community dialogue meetings.

The overarching goal of the Framework is the consolidation of peace and stability, with three interrelated areas of cooperation having emerged as particularly critical for United Nations country team support: (a) democratization and social cohesion; (b) poverty reduction and sustainable livelihoods; and (c) basic social services. The total funding for the five-year period of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework is expected to be approximately $314 million.

President Ramos-Horta’s efforts in this regard are to be commended, as is the receptivity, so far, of the major political groupings in Timor-Leste. My Special Representative will continue to provide good offices to facilitate such efforts, with a focus on the importance of constructive political Parliament in a multiparty democracy; and appreciation for the contribution that can be made by an effective opposition channelling its concerns through democratic means.

"54. Ongoing discussions with State actors at all levels reveal a general consensus that the gradual resumption of policing responsibilities should not be bound by an artificial calendar that may not accurately reflect the readiness of the national police in any given district or unit. Instead, emphasis must be placed on the achievement of criteria in order to guarantee the integrity of the resumption process and ensure that any future crisis or pressure does not result in the police service facing further systemic failures. Based on this view, the Government and UNMIT are now discussing the possibility of starting the process of the resumption of policing responsibilities on 27 March 2009. In the meantime, a continuing robust UNMIT police presence across the country, including formed police units, is necessary, both to support the resumption of responsibilities and to continue to help guarantee public security while that process is under way. To that end, I urge the Government to continue working with UNMIT to further develop the framework for resumption of policing responsibility and to ensure that steps are taken to meet sustainable logistical requirements for the national police. The resumption will be only one step in the long-term development process of the national police, and will depend on the continuing commitment of the Government and the international community, including bilateral partners.",54,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2009_72.pdf,UNMIT_S_2009_72.pdf,UNMIT_S_2009_72,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

Based on the agreement concluded by the Prime Minister and my Special Representative on 13 May 2009 (see S/2009/504, para. 20), which reiterates the mutually agreed criteria for the resumption of primary policing responsibilities by PNTL, joint assessment teams of civilian and police representatives from the Government and UNMIT assessed all 13 districts and three units as of 20 January. In total, 19 assessments were conducted, including of some districts which were assessed more than once. As of 20 January, PNTL had resumed primary policing responsibilities in four districts (Lautem, Manatuto, Oecussi and Viqueque) and three units (Police Training Centre, Maritime Unit and Intelligence Service). In addition, the Prime Minister and my Special Representative have agreed that the resumption by PNTL of primary policing responsibilities in two additional districts, Ainaro and Baucau, would be scheduled for March.

"26. Past experience has shown that one of the greatest threats to stability can be the security forces themselves. Not atypical among post-liberation and post-conflict contexts, security sector reform in Timor-Leste continues to be a slow process of change with a limited base of national ownership. Nonetheless, under the leadership of the President and the Prime Minister, progress has been made in reforms at the sector-wide level and also in the development of both F-FDTL and PNTL, as well as other security providers. Still, significant challenges remain, some of which contributed to the 2006 crisis. These include civilian oversight and management, and the definition and delineation of roles and responsibilities between F-FDTL and PNTL. The Government is taking measures aimed at addressing those challenges, including the development of a national security policy and draft security sector legislation. Challenges also persist in terms of institutional capacity, including internal accountability mechanisms, professionalism and respect for human rights and gender equality. Concerns about politicization of and discrimination within the security forces appear to have lessened, but remain relevant. In this regard, while the risk of confrontation between PNTL and F-FDTL is seen by most interlocutors as having diminished since 2006, perceptions of the “militarization” of PNTL, focusing on renewed visibility of special units armed with long-barrelled weapons, are a concern. calm, but there continue to be disputes stemming mainly from the use of the land in the vicinity of unresolved sections of the border.

Persistent inequalities in the distribution of wealth may create new fault lines or accentuate old ones. Sudden economic shocks or unsound fiscal management could affect the general security situation. These issues have been somewhat mitigated by the Government’s strategies, which include relying on oil money for expanded public employment, cash transfer payments to vulnerable segments of the population, salary increases and Government contracts for infrastructure and other projects.

At the meeting hosted by the President on 9 December 2009 and during the technical assessment mission, the Timorese authorities expressed their views regarding the future role of UNMIT police during the 2010-2012 period. Among their proposals were to: (a) expedite the process of PNTL resumption of policing responsibilities, with resumption in Dili by June 2010 and in all districts and units by the end of 2010; (b) reduce the UNMIT formed police unit presence in Dili; disciplinary procedures; (d) extend co-location and reconfigure the UNMIT police to provide operational, administrative and management support to PNTL and to improve mentoring and training; (e) provide training within a plan developed by PNTL, making available officers with specialized skill sets from a smaller number of contributing countries; and (f) renegotiate the Supplemental Policing Arrangement, in particular to avoid situations of “double command” and review the “certification” process.",63,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2010_85.pdf,UNMIT_S_2010_85.pdf,UNMIT_S_2010_85,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
"64. In early 2009, the Government of Timor-Leste and UNMIT reached agreement on the process for resumption by PNTL of primary responsibilities for the conduct of police operations, district by district and unit by unit, in accordance with mutually agreed criteria. The resumption of primary policing responsibilities by PNTL commenced in May 2009 in Lautem district, and the Oecussi and Manatuto districts, the Police Training Centre, Viqueque district, the Maritime Unit and the National Intelligence Service were handed over by the end of 2009. Decisions have already been taken that the Baucau and Ainaro districts will be handed over in early 2010. UNMIT will make all efforts to ensure that the resumption process is completed by the end of 2010. However, Government planning, especially budgetary processes, does not seem to take into account the increased requirements of PNTL that would accompany such a handover and the subsequent reconfiguration of the UNMIT police.",64,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2010_85.pdf,UNMIT_S_2010_85.pdf,UNMIT_S_2010_85,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

Following the resumption of policing responsibilities in the districts and units, UNMIT police have been monitoring, advising and assisting PNTL, while remaining available to provide operational support, and in extremis, reassume interim law enforcement, if requested and required. A joint monitoring mechanism is in place to monitor the progress of PNTL in districts and units where they have resumed policing responsibilities in order to sustain the continual reform and transfer of skills. This monitoring system needs to be significantly strengthened and better utilized, and co-location of members of the UNMIT police and PNTL must be accelerated and completed as a matter of urgency.",65,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2010_85.pdf,UNMIT_S_2010_85.pdf,UNMIT_S_2010_85,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
"66. Continued efforts have led to further progress in the registration, screening and certification programme for PNTL, with 2,896 (578 women) officers, or 92 per cent of the service, fully certified. The registration and certification programme requires the removal of uncertified officers from PNTL. The remaining uncertified officers face pending criminal and disciplinary proceedings. The Government has so far taken measures against six non-certified officers who were convicted of crimes and a seventh officer for not registering. However, the Government still needs to adopt and issue relevant legislation to ensure the effective implementation of the certification programme, with the assistance of UNMIT or other stakeholders, if needed. Taking account of those factors, UNMIT is currently discussing possible solutions with the Government to ensure that uncertified officers are suspended or dismissed.

"68. There are still major factors to be taken into account in the requirements for policing in the next two years: elections scheduled for 2010-2012; major civic activities and celebrations; the possibility that the security situation could escalate in a very short time from an isolated incident; underlying security risks stemming from unresolved grievances from the past; and poverty and unemployment, which can give rise to heightened tensions and increasing criminal activity by martial arts groups or others. The Public Order Battalion of PNTL does not yet have the capacity, training, logistical support and equipment to assume crowd control responsibilities throughout the country. There is, therefore, a need to maintain a robust presence of UNMIT formed police units, even after the full reconstitution of PNTL, to ensure a nationwide crowd control response capability. UNMIT police will also provide static security support; pre-emptive police visibility at special and major events, activities and demonstrations; and mentoring and training of the PNTL Public Order Battalion. Two formed police unit platoons (of 35 officers each) will be withdrawn by December 2010.

The Military Liaison Group maintains posts in the border districts of Bobonaro, Covalima and Oecussi and one post each in Dili and Baucau. Those posts maintain liaison with Indonesian and Timorese border control forces, F-FDTL and international security forces.

"73. Despite the setbacks of 2006, Timor-Leste has continued to make progress in this area. While the overall number of human rights violations committed by the security forces declined from 2008 to 2009, excessive use of force remains a concern. The report of the independent comprehensive needs assessment of the justice sector, completed in October 2009, has been welcomed by the Government, including the Minister of Justice. It focuses on the need for specialized training of legal actors, strengthening the justice institutions, improving police-prosecution cooperation and establishing an effective legal aid system. Clear deficiencies were identified regarding judicial independence, separation of powers, promoting professional responsibility, confronting impunity, requiring accountability, gender justice and child rights. The Government has been engaged in a consultative process to develop the first draft of the Justice Sector Strategic Plan for Timor-Leste, including corrections. It is expected that the Plan will be adopted in early 2010 and that it will form the basis of a constructive, collaborative and nationally owned strategic reform process for the justice sector.

"81. The importance of completing investigations for offences committed in 2006 which had been identified by the Special Commission of Inquiry, as well as for those committed in 1999, as mandated by the Security Council, remains. While investigations of serious crimes committed in 1999 have continued through the work of the Serious Crimes Investigation Team, there has been only limited progress in bringing cases to trial. Civil society organizations expressed to the assessment mission their strong desire to see justice and accountability delivered for serious crimes and human rights violations committed in the past. The divisions over the issue of accountability and impunity pose a challenge to the country and the United Nations. The proposed follow-on institution to the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation and the Commission for Truth and Friendship will be vital as a means to promote reconciliation. administrative tools and physical infrastructure to administer justice properly, fairly or effectively. The capacity and, at times, willingness of the justice and law enforcement institutions to fairly and effectively detect, investigate, prosecute and adjudicate criminal offences, in particular those relating to corruption, violence against children, sexual assault and domestic violence, remain weak. Key obstacles to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system include inadequate coordination between the police and the prosecution service, a lack of understanding by law enforcement and justice officials of the applicable laws and procedures for investigation, and language barriers. As a consequence, only a small number of cases are appropriately dealt with before the courts, and the number of pending cases at the prosecution service remains high. While the work of the Office of the Public Defender has increased access to justice for the Timorese population, not all requests for legal assistance can be responded to, and the capacity of private lawyers remains limited.

A major challenge in this regard relates to language: while the Government requires primary education to be conducted in Portuguese and Tetum, the majority of teachers are not sufficiently proficient in Portuguese, and the development and standardization of written Tetum have been delayed and received insufficient support.

On 16 March, the Human Rights Council adopted the outcome of the universal periodic review on Timor-Leste (see A/HRC/DEC/19/115; S/2012/43, para. 35). The Government of Timor-Leste accepted, inter alia, recommendations to ratify additional international human rights treaties and to report on the status of implementation of treaties already ratified. On 21 June, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights presented the report on her mission to Timor-Leste (13-18 November 2011) to the Human Rights Council, with recommendations for the country to focus on implementing social and economic policies that ensure inclusive and equitable growth and development for all the population, including with regard to the institutional and legal framework, improving access to justice, education, health and land rights, and strengthening the social protection system (A/HRC/20/25/Add.1; see S/2012/43, para. 37). On 5 March, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances presented the report on its visit to Timor-Leste (7-14 February 2011) to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/19/58/Add.1). In the report, the Working Group acknowledged the many efforts that Timor-Leste had made since its independence despite the challenges it faced, including in bringing about a process of national reconciliation, but considered that more remained to be done to achieve the right to truth, justice and reparation for those who disappeared and their families. In March and June 2012, the Government of Timor-Leste made statements to the Human Rights Council regarding the reports on the universal periodic review and the visit of the Special Rapporteur; civil society organizations also actively engaged with the mechanisms, with the support of UNMIT.",42,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2012_765.pdf,UNMIT_S_2012_765.pdf,UNMIT_S_2012_765,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

During the reporting period, the Office of the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice recruited 32 new staff (17 women) to strengthen capacity at its Dili headquarters and regional offices (see S/2011/641, para. 42). It monitored the human rights situation during the elections, with technical support from UNMIT, and shared its observations in a report released to the public on 19 July. A group of four new legal advisers (three women) at the Office of the Provedor underwent a three-month training course on international human rights law with other legal advisers from the Ministry of Justice and the Office of the President, which was facilitated by UNMIT. Additional support continued to be provided through a joint programme of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and UNDP aimed at strengthening the Office of the Provedor. Despite continuing capacity-building requirements, the Office of the Provedor functioned as an independent and effective institution to protect and promote human rights, thus meeting the related medium-term strategy benchmark. Serious Crimes Investigation Team continued its investigations into cases relating to crimes against humanity and other serious crimes committed between 1 January and 25 October 1999.

The development of the Plan was led and coordinated by the Office of the Secretary of State for the Promotion of Equality, with support from a multi-sector national drafting committee, UNDP, UNFPA, UN-Women, UNICEF, UNMIT and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). It entailed a one- year process of broad consultations to ensure the support of various ministries, State institutions, civil society actors and other stakeholders necessary for its implementation. The Plan focuses on three strategic areas of intervention: prevention of gender-based violence, provision of services to victims and access to justice for victims.",47,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2012_765.pdf,UNMIT_S_2012_765.pdf,UNMIT_S_2012_765,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

During the reporting period, pieces of draft legislation concerning certain critical areas, including draft laws relating to juvenile justice and access to the courts as well as land and property rights, remained to be adopted and/or promulgated, with some gaps remaining in the regulatory framework. There were notable developments in the corrections area, supported by UNMIT and UNDP, including the promulgation, on 29 February, of the Decree-Law on the Special Career Regime and Statute of Prison Guards and subsequent completion of specialized training for the prison guard staff of the National Prison Service on the treatment of prisoners and conflict resolution. The first version of standard operating procedures for the National Prison Service was completed, covering such areas as administration, case management, inmate rights, security, health and discipline, with the National Directorate for Prison Services and Social Reintegration establishing working groups to lead discussions on the text.

"49. Improving access to justice for all segments of the population remains one of the major challenges in the sector. The limited number of public defenders, lack of a comprehensive legal aid regulatory framework and lack of availability of donor funding for legal aid services beyond August (with discussions ongoing as at 20 September) have hindered access, particularly for the most vulnerable groups. Continued training courses for judges, prosecutors, public defenders and private lawyers and other efforts by the Legal Training Centre, supported by UNDP, have helped to address human resources-related capacity gaps, including with the graduation of the first seven private lawyers on 4 July. However, the Centre itself still faces considerable constraints, including as regards human resources and technical and strategic management capacities, resulting in continued dependence on international personnel for certain expertise. Continued support for strengthening national expertise and capacities is thus required. With the support of UNMIT and UNFPA, various initiatives were undertaken to enhance access to justice for victims of domestic and gender-based violence and strengthen accountability for such crimes, such as the integration of gender-based violence investigative skills in the curriculum of the Police Training Centre and a related two-week training course for PNTL officers (30 May to 12 June), as well as the launching of a manual for legal aid lawyers on addressing gender-based violence in Timor-Leste. To facilitate enhanced public confidence in the formal justice system, the Ministry of Justice placed greater focus on public outreach and advocacy, including through a UNDP- supported series of justice-related broadcasts on UNMIT’s weekly radio programme and a number of “Taking justice to the people” outreach sessions in various communities.",49,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2012_765.pdf,UNMIT_S_2012_765.pdf,UNMIT_S_2012_765,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
"50. As reflected above, further progress was made towards meeting the objectives and benchmarks of the medium-term strategy in the areas of rule of law, justice and human rights. However, additional efforts are particularly needed to address challenges relating to accountability mechanisms, traditional justice and the implementation of certain laws. Justice sector accountability mechanisms need to be further strengthened, including through efforts to enhance the work of the Superior Councils for the Judiciary, the Public Prosecution Service and the Public Defender, and of the Management and Discipline Council for the Practice of Law. The development of codes of conduct for judges, prosecutors, public defenders and private lawyers is pending. As regards the benchmark for a legal framework which takes into account traditional justice mechanisms that adhere to basic principles of the administration of justice and human rights standards, the reconciliation of traditional and formal justice systems will require more time to address, particularly in terms of handling domestic and gender-based violence. Implementation of certain key laws, such as the Law against Domestic Violence, as well as related monitoring mechanisms, could be enhanced. Considering that investigations into 85 outstanding cases of serious crimes had not been completed by the Serious Crimes Investigation Team as at 20 September (see para. 44 above) and that it is projected that, by the end of the mandate on 31 December, about 20 additional cases will be completed, the related benchmark will not be met by December 2012. socioeconomic development and humanitarian assistance A.

Together with other stakeholders, the Government and UNMIT continued to collaborate and make further progress on the transition process, including in the context of the High-level Committee on Transition (see S/2012/43, para. 51), which held meetings on 2 February, 27 April, 10 August (just two days after the formation of the new Government) and 20 September (see para. 60 below). At the 10 August meeting, chaired by President Taur Matan Ruak and attended by the Vice-Prime Minister, the President of Parliament, various Government ministers and representatives, the PNTL General Commander, the F-FDTL Commander and my Acting Special Representative and the UNMIT senior management team, the Committee reviewed progress in the implementation of the Joint Transition Plan in Plan mechanism, the Government confirmed its new focal points for the seven transition focus areas. With respect to the policing area, the PNTL General Commander and UNMIT Police Commissioner gave a presentation on the status of implementation of the activities under the PNTL-UNMIT Police Joint Development Plan (see paras. 21, 24 and 25 above) and discussed the ongoing process to facilitate preparation for certification of the full reconstitution of PNTL as well as the UNMIT police drawdown plan and the projected end of operational support to PNTL by 31 October (see para. 28 above). The monitoring of the Joint Transition Plan for the April-June 2012 quarter showed continued good progress in the implementation of activities, with 83 per cent of the Plan’s 129 activities progressing as planned and activities, on average, 68 per cent completed as at 30 June.

"61. In a further effort to facilitate completion of its mandate and a smooth transition, UNMIT entered into an innovative partnership with four United Nations country team members (UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and UN-Women) to carry out particular mandated activities from July to December 2012, with UNMIT financial support and arrangements set out in memorandums of understanding. These partnership arrangements, which relate to activities set out in the Integrated Strategic Framework for Timor-Leste 2011-2012 in the medium-term strategy priority areas of ensuring security and stability, rule of law, justice and human rights, a culture of democratic governance and dialogue, and socioeconomic development, are also in line with my initiative on civilian capacity in the aftermath of conflict (see A/66/311-S/2011/527 and A/67/312-S/2012/645). On 22 February, former President Ramos-Horta and Chair of the United Nations Development Group, Helen Clark, co-chaired a Member States consultation on Timor-Leste, moderated by my former Special Representative, Ameerah Haq, with representatives of the Permanent Missions to the United Nations as well as United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and various departments. At the event, the Minister of Finance presented a portfolio of 34 United Nations country team projects, formulated together with the Government, in support of the consolidation of peace year period (2012-2014) and requires total funding of approximately $76 million, or $25.3 million per year.

"70. As expressed during my recent visit, Timor-Leste has made impressive advances during the decade since the restoration of its independence, particularly since the crisis in 2006, which led to the establishment of UNMIT, and my visit to the country in December 2007 (see S/2008/26, paras. 13-14). In 2010, the United Nations technical assessment mission noted that the country had recovered from the 2006 crisis insofar as the immediate challenges had been resolved (see S/2010/85, paras. 21 and 22), including with stability and security restored, the return of about 150,000 internally displaced persons and the closure of all tented camps, and the gradual reintegration of the dismissed F-FDTL “petitioners” into civilian life. The security situation has remained calm and stable since the first post-2006 test of the attacks on the President and the Prime Minister on 11 February 2008 (see S/2008/501, paras. 3 and 4). PNTL exercised responsibility for the conduct of all police operations in Timor-Leste in the past 18 months, and the reported crime rate has remained low, with UNMIT police focusing on further institutional development and capacity-building while providing operational support in certain areas (see para. 21 above).",70,data/pdfs\UNMIT_S_2012_765.pdf,UNMIT_S_2012_765.pdf,UNMIT_S_2012_765,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

While the rockets did not explode and there were no casualties, the gravity of this attack and its potential to escalate the tensions led UNOMIG to dispatch a fact-finding team the next day to two of the three impact sites and to the Tkvarcheli district, from which the Georgian side had assessed that the firing had taken place. The team’s preliminary findings were that the rockets had most likely been fired from the southern ridge of the Kodori valley, but it was not possible to ascertain the exact firing location or the identity of the perpetrators. The Mission’s findings rested primarily on signs of burning in and around the two impact sites visited, which was assumed to have been caused by burning engine fuel from a regular GRAD (BM-21) fragmentation rocket. However, in the course of the investigation by the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs, one of the rockets was extracted and identified as a rare and obsolete incendiary rocket manufactured in 1984. Laboratory analysis conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the burned material revealed an incendiary substance used in this type of rocket, which may have resulted in the burning that the UNOMIG fact-finding team assumed to have been caused by operating rocket engines. This finding invalidates the assumptions which were the basis for UNOMIG’s preliminary report, rendering its conclusions no longer tenable. UNOMIG remains seized of this matter and, in cooperation with the two sides, hopes that further investigation will be able to clarify the circumstances and perpetrators of the incident.",23,data/pdfs\UNOMIG_S_2007_15.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2007_15.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2007_15,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

From 5 to 7 March, UNOMIG and the CIS peacekeeping force conducted a third joint patrol of the lower and upper Kodori valley after a two-month break due to adverse weather and road conditions (see S/2007/15, paras. 19 and 20). The joint patrol was provided with the usual security guarantees and excellent cooperation from both sides. It aimed at ensuring transparency in the deployment of security forces in the valley and observing its consistency with the 1994 Moscow Agreement. The joint patrol travelled extensively throughout lower and upper Kodori valley and was afforded full access to security personnel, posts and installations. The patrol en route did not observe any change in the deployment of the Abkhaz militia check posts in the lower Kodori valley. In the upper Kodori valley, Georgian officials provided details of their security force deployment, under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. It included 284 personnel on rotational deployment from the criminal police and special tasks departments; and 100 locally recruited border guards. The personnel from the criminal police and special tasks departments were armed with personal weapons. Section weapons (rocket-propelled grenade launchers and machine guns) were available for deployment from armouries. Ammunition stores and logistic and maintenance bases were open for inspection. The patrol saw boxes of 23mm ammunition that had been declared during the previous patrol. Georgian officials reiterated that there were no heavy weapons corresponding to this ammunition. The patrol recommended that, in accordance with the 1994 Moscow Agreement, this ammunition be withdrawn from the valley. In general, the patrol did not observe any deployment of heavy weapons. The patrol observed that the two armoured recovery vehicles that were inspected in December 2006 had been converted to provide a medical evacuation capability under the Red Cross sign. UNOMIG would propose that they be replaced with civilian vehicles once the Khida Pass is reopened.

"49. Against this positive background, the events of 11 March in the upper Kodori valley were a major setback. While, fortunately, causing no casualty, the incident offered a reminder of the risks with which the conflict is still fraught, and the potential for existing tensions to take a violent course. I hope that the investigation carried out by the Joint Fact-Finding Group will help clarify the circumstances behind this incident; and I am grateful to the two sides for the moderation they have shown in their public statements and for allowing the Group the time needed to fulfil its difficult task. I also believe that, after the October 2006 incident when three surface-to-surface missiles landed in the upper Kodori valley, this new development highlights the need for the parties and the international community to approach the situation in the Kodori valley also in terms of prevention. Indeed, with very limited international observation, the Kodori valley will most likely remain vulnerable to further incidents if no measures are taken. The planned reactivation, security permitting, of the UNOMIG team base in Adjara, in the upper Kodori valley, will partially address this issue.

Since late December those restrictions have been lifted.,25,data/pdfs\UNOMIG_S_2008_38.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2008_38.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2008_38,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
"26. On 10 December, the building of a Human Rights Centre, refurbished with funding from the UNOMIG Trust Fund, was officially opened in Gali. Its opening coincided with the launch of a United Nations system-wide year-long campaign dedicated to the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and was attended by representatives of UNOMIG, the Tbilisi-based Group of Friends and members of several Gali- and Sukhumi-based non-governmental organizations that founded the Human Rights Centre.

"31. During the reporting period, the de facto Abkhaz authorities claimed that the strength of the Georgian law enforcement agencies in the security zone had increased up to 2,000, far beyond the agreed level of 600. The strength of law enforcement agencies in the security zone on both sides of the ceasefire line was last verified jointly by UNOMIG and CIS peacekeeping force before the Kodori special operation of July 2006. Accurate monitoring is an exercise that requires cooperation by all sides and an atmosphere of trust. As described in the present report, such conditions hardly exist at present. Taking into account these limitations, UNOMIG observers in the Zugdidi sector remained focused on the issue but have not reported, during the period under review, any apparent change in the overall level of the Georgian law enforcement personnel. Given the population of the Zugdidi district, which is much larger than that of the Gali district, and the fact that the area of responsibility of police precincts does not coincide with the boundaries of the security zone, precise determination of the number of Georgian law enforcement personnel strength may not be possible. It may be in excess of 600 but not in alarming proportions.",31,data/pdfs\UNOMIG_S_2008_38.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2008_38.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2008_38,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
"32. During the reporting period, UNOMIG continued to observe routine movements towards the upper Kodori Valley by Ministry of Internal Affairs personnel and vehicles, consisting mainly of logistical vehicles travelling through the end of October in preparation for the winter season. Movement through the security zone decreased from November because of deteriorating road conditions. Fewer over-flights over the security zone were observed, because, in the Mission’s understanding, the Georgian side is using alternative air routes to reach the Kodori Valley. UNOMIG issued 12 violation reports, for the most part involving isolated military vehicles observed on route M-27 or in the town of Zugdidi. The agreed to and from upper Kodori Valley, in most cases were not followed by the Georgian side during the reporting period.",32,data/pdfs\UNOMIG_S_2008_38.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2008_38.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2008_38,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
"36. The UNOMIG team based in Adjara maintained its patrolling in both the Georgian-controlled upper Kodori Valley and the Abkhaz-controlled lower Kodori Valley. It continued to report no presence of heavy weapons throughout the Valley. The Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs reported its strength in the upper Kodori Valley at 578 personnel as of mid-November. While UNOMIG was not able to verify the exact personnel strength, contrary to claims by the Abkhaz side it has not encountered indicators of significant reinforcement or introduction of military equipment in the upper Kodori Valley. At the same time, UNOMIG has observed construction of additional infrastructure, especially accommodation and storage facilities.",36,data/pdfs\UNOMIG_S_2008_38.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2008_38.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2008_38,False,True,True,False,False,False,False
"37. Weekly quadripartite meetings remained suspended. The Joint Fact-Finding Group has nine cases open, four of which are awaiting closure. The focus remains the investigation into the disappearance of Davit Sigua (see S/2007/182, para. 15). In this regard, the Group had held six meetings as at 24 December 2007. The investigation was on hold between mid-September and mid-December owing to the unavailability of some important witnesses and UNOMIG involvement in other high profile incidents, including the Bokhundjara incident of 20 September.",37,data/pdfs\UNOMIG_S_2008_38.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2008_38.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2008_38,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
"38. The UNOMIG Fact-Finding Team completed its independent investigation into the 20 September deadly armed incident between the Abkhaz and Georgian sides at Bokhundjara in the Tqkvarcheli region (see S/2007/588, para. 18). Further to the progress report provided to the Security Council on 12 October, the investigation was able to establish the following: (a) The incident took place at approximately 300 metres on the Abkhaz side of the administrative border; (b) Regarding the circumstances of the killing of the two former Russian officers who were leading the group, the report of the UNOMIG medical forensic expert, the fact that none of the interviewees, from the Georgian and Abkhaz side, pointed to a deliberate execution of the two men and the certainty that no shooting took place after the clash ended led the Fact Finding Team to conclude that the two officers died as a result of shooting at close and point-blank range in a close-quarter battle environment; (c) With regard to the circumstances of the clash, the Georgian side claimed that it was a result of an operation directed against a subversive group operating on Georgian-controlled territory, while the Abkhaz side claimed that it was an unprovoked attack against a group of de facto border guard trainees. While not in a possession of compelling evidence, the Fact-Finding Team has concluded that inconsistencies in the testimonies of Abkhaz personnel interviewed in Tbilisi and Sukhumi, as well as some details of their activities had led to the assumption that there might have been Abkhaz operational activities going on that were unrelated to the activities of the group that came under attack. At the same time, judging from the lack of service experience and professional knowledge, and the demeanour of the Abkhaz group involved in the clash, as well as their lack of long-range communication assets, the Fact-Finding Team deemed it improbable that this particular group had participated in special operations on the Georgian-controlled side.",38,data/pdfs\UNOMIG_S_2008_38.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2008_38.pdf,UNOMIG_S_2008_38,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
"42. UNOMIG and CIS peacekeeping forces maintained close cooperation in fulfilling their respective mandates. The CIS peacekeeping force continued to escort UNOMIG through the lower Kodori Valley during regular rotation of personnel for its Kodori Team Base. The CIS peacekeeping force also provided assistance to UNOMIG temporary forward bases, which were established periodically adjacent to CIS peacekeeping force checkpoints on both sides of the ceasefire. With full cooperation and freedom of access from the CIS peacekeeping force, UNOMIG monitored the rotation of units from the Northern Operational Group conducted in December (see para. 20).
